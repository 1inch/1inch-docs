# Introduction

1inch limit order protocol is a set of smart contracts, that can work on any EVM based blockchains
(Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Gnosis chain, Avalanche). Key features of the protocol is **extreme flexibility** and high **gas efficiency** that achieved by using two different order types - regular _Limit Order_ and _RFQ Order_.

Smart Contract allows users to place limit orders and RFQ Orders, that later could be filled on-chain.
Both type of orders is a data structure created off-chain and signed according to [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712).

A limit order is a financial instrument with which you can put up an ERC-20 token for sale at a fixed price.  
For example, you can put up for sale 2 WBTC tokens at the price of 82415 DAI tokens.

1inch limit orders protocol has many tools for flexible trade management:

-   Partial fill
-   Predicates
-   Single cancellation
-   Bunch cancellation
-   Fullness check
-   Validation

> There is an extensive set of utilities for creating and managing limit orders available [here](https://github.com/1inch/limit-order-protocol-utils/)



> **Note:** For market makers, there is a specialised **RFQ order** that has been optimized to decrease the gas required for execution. For more detals see: [The Difference Between Limit and RFQ Orders](/docs/limit-order-protocol/limitvsrfq)

### Limit order execution

1. 1inch users can place their limit orders via 1inch [dApp](https://app.1inch.io/#/1/limit-order/WETH/DAI) or via the [1inch Limit Orders Liquidity Source API](./api).
1. Anyone can fetch this signed orders using [1inch Limit Orders Liquidity Source API](./api) and trade by filling the order on-chain.
1. To do that they pass signed order to the `fillOrder` method on the contract:
    - Latest addresses is always [here](https://github.com/1inch/limit-order-protocol-utils/blob/master/src/limit-order-protocol.const.ts)
    > ***Note:*** Limit order users (buyers and sellers) should approve the asset to be used by 1inch limit order contract.
4. The Pathfinder Algorithm use limit orders placed via `dApp` and REST API as a liquidity source, making them available to fill be any 1inch user..
So, 1inch limit orders are integrated into the DeFi ecosystem from the day one.
