# Introduction

:::caution

The public Swap API api.1inch.io is deprecated. To continue using the Swap API please migrate to the [**1inch Developer Portal**](https://portal.1inch.dev)

:::

The 1inch API v5, Pathfinder, is a cutting-edge discovery and routing algorithm, which offers asset exchanges at the best rates on the market. Pathfinder finds the most efficient paths for a token swap, able to split between different protocols and even different market depths in within one protocol in the shortest possible time.

:::info
If you are an enterprise with significant trading volumes, please [**complete this application**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdU7Ahn3YmbssoQiTbs0Fk0TB_7al9O_4ZQIUiZp3OxYzfWtg/viewform) so we can assign you a custom API endpoint. The enterprise endpoint will offer significantly better performance across market rates and response times.
