The proposal has been coordinated with 1inch core team and is seeking funding of $2M to complete the product trade version (PTV) of the 1inch hardware wallet. With this funding, we will be able to finalize the product development, set up the manufacturing process, and pass technical and security audits for a successful launch. Our goal is to provide the DeFi community with a cutting-edge solution for handling their crypto assets in a secure, convenient and open-source way, as well as benefit the 1inch ecosystem.</p><h2>Abstract</h2><p>We are building the 1inch hardware wallet as a fully open-source project to enhance 1inch ecosystem and empower the DeFi community with a cutting-edge solution for handling their crypto assets in a simple, convenient and secure way.</p><p>Launched under the 1inch grant program (which you can read about here) the project is currently moving into the product finalisation stage. The waitlist for the product is currently hosted through 1inch subdomain - hw.1inch.io.</p><p>We have been working closely with the 1inch core team and have already coordinated the next steps for the project&#x27;s development as well as the following proposal.</p><p>As we move forward, we are seeking funds to complete the product trade version (PTV), set up the manufacturing process and undergo technical and security audits to ensure safety and a smooth sales launch.</p><h2>Motivation</h2><ul><li>Launch the first hardware wallet designed specifically for the DeFi community. The wallet will feature transparent signing, data decoding, open-sourced hardware &amp; firmware, seamless navigation, HD-wallet support, and a multi-seed wallet.</li><li>Expand the capabilities of the 1inch Mobile Wallet and provide seamless integration with the hardware wallet. The 1inch Mobile App will serve as a primary dApp for the hardware wallet, allowing users to easily access a range of DeFi protocols from a single interface.</li><li>Make it easy for users to backup and recover the funds. Along with 1inch hardware wallet, weare developing simple backup and recovery solutions, which allow users to export the seed phrase to an external drive.</li></ul><h2>Specification</h2><p>The 1inch hardware wallet will be integrated into the 1inch, expanding the 1inch Mobile Wallet ecosystem. It will provide the safest option for storing and managing private keys in a simple, easy, and offline way. Moreover, by launching the hardware wallet under the 1inch branding, we aim to increase brand awareness and establish an additional touchpoint with the DeFi community.</p><p><strong>1inch Hardware Wallet key features:</strong></p><ul><li>Focus on open-source security (users can verify and reprogram the firmware, authenticity check and more)</li><li>Enhanced integration with 1inch dApp</li><li>Multi-seed option, which enables users to create and control several sets of wallets with different seed phrases (HD wallet algorithm)</li><li>Fully air-gapped device with QR code or NFC connection options</li><li>Sleek and elegant form factor (lightweight, credit card size)</li><li>Transparent transaction signing conducted with full transaction parsing and call data analysis (includes data decoding)</li><li>Convenient UX/UI and essential functions (wireless, long-lasting battery, etc.)</li></ul><h2>Roadmap</h2><p>In 2022, the Hardware Wallet team received a grant of $175k from the 1inch Foundation to develop an MVP (Minimal Valuable Product) of the hardware wallet. The funds were allocated as follows: 15% for supplies and components required for product design, 72 % for team and contractor costs, and 13% for operational expenses. As a result, the team created a working demo board with core functions, including wallet connection and transactions signing, and documented constructed product design.</p><p>As of now, we have successfully moved from MVP to EVT1 stage and completed a working engineer prototype. The team is conducting the alpha test and working on device integration into the 1inch Mobile Wallet app.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRwbWE6GfgY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EVT1 Live Demo</a></p><p>The second and third quarters of 2023 are dedicated to product refinement to the PVT (Product Validation Test, Trade Version), product acceptance, QA and manufacturing, building integrations and partnerships, international laboratory tests &amp; certifications, and setting up sales channels.</p><h2>Costs</h2><p>Breakdown of the costs by groups for the project duration (6 months):</p><ul><li>Manufacturing and procurement costs (from beta to the first batch with limited edition) - $600k</li><li>Backups &amp; recovery solutions - $75k</li><li>Development costs, inc. salaries, product management, contractors - $490k</li><li>Technical performance tests verification and certifications from labs - $110k</li><li>Security testing and evaluation - $85k</li><li>Trade licenses, regional policies and legal establishment- $120k</li><li>Patent registration - $40k</li><li>Operational costs and corp services - $100k</li><li>Sales and supply channels configuration- $250k</li><li>Design, onboarding, community price promos - $95k</li><li>Partnerships, integrations, business development - $35k</li></ul><p>Total: $2M</p><h2>Payment structure</h2><p>We suggest an upfront payment of $2 million to ensure swift progress and timely delivery. This significant initial investment is pivotal for the successful execution of this hardware project. As we have to secure contracts with component providers right from the outset, the upfront capital will be instrumental in negotiating the best prices. We can take advantage of economies of scale and secure cost-effective deals by purchasing higher-quality components.</p><p>As a start-up company, flexibility is crucial in our operations. Situations may evolve, and adjustments may be required along the way. However, we are fully committed to transparency and accountability in using the funds.</p><p>We will provide the DAO with comprehensive documentation upon request at any point during our journey. This documentation will detail how funds are utilised, ensuring that every dollar is spent towards delivering a top-quality product for the benefit of 1inch DAO and 1inch ecosystem.</p><p>We will also update the 1inch DAO on our progress through forum posts, Github and our Telegram channel. In this way, every step we take will be visible, maintaining an open line of communication and transparency throughout the project&#x27;s development.</p><p>Receiving address: 0xaBDd020b11eDf6838135270FECaefA7DaF08D2D7</p><h2>Rationale</h2><p>Our primary motivation for the 1inch hardware wallet development and sales launch is to provide the DeFi community with a secure, user-friendly, and convenient solution to manage their digital assets. An offline, air-gapped solution for private key storage that is built with users and for users, eliminating the risks of online attacks and hacking attempts.</p><h2>Considerations</h2><h3>Team</h3><p>To date, the 1inch Hardware Wallet core team includes:</p><ul><li>Founder (12+ years experience in hardware engineering, development, electronic manufacturing. 4 hardware startups)</li><li>Project Manager (10+ years in software PM, 2+ years in hardware PM)</li><li>Application Team Lead (17+ years in app &amp; software development, main - C++)</li><li>2 Senior C++ programmers (8+ years xp)</li><li>Embedded Team Lead (specialization - Embedded security , SK Hynix)</li><li>2 Embedded developers (7+ years xp)</li><li>Mechanical designer (From Huawei Inc)</li><li>PCB &amp; Circuit designer</li><li>Production and Procurement Lead (supplies purchasing company owner, 10+ years in BA)</li><li>Marketing Manager (5+ in an omnichannel marketing)</li><li>HR manager</li><li>Legal</li><li>4 part-time contributors: community, design, vendors, analytics</li></ul><p>Team expansion is planned in the following directions: sales.</p><h3>Commitments</h3><p>We are dedicated to the development of 1inch Hardware Wallet project successful implementation and delivery of the 1inch Hardware Wallet (HW) project, in close collaboration with the 1inch core team and 1inch DAO, and with its strategic interests at the core of our operations. We are resolute in providing an unrivaled product that will significantly enrich the 1inch ecosystem and offer immeasurable benefits to the 1inch community.</p><p>Recognizing the importance of clear communication and unequivocal commitment, we have outlined the key focus areas to assure 1inch DAO of our dedication to the project&#x27;s success and bringing benefits to 1inch ecosystem and 1inch DAO as a result.</p><ul><li><strong>Commitment to Project Completion:</strong> Hardware Team has pledged to complete the 1inch Hardware Wallet project, promising to utilize the grant prudently to ensure the product reaches the highest level of quality.

To attract, select and retain the best talent, we suggest vetting each Recognised Delegate (group/individual) based on past performance in 1inchDAO and other DAOs and a compensation structure.</p><h2>Motivation</h2><p>Crypto is speed-running in the history of human coordination. As DAOs evolve from their early idealistic vision to becoming more internet-native organisations, so too must the coordination mechanisms evolve. We have seen that specialisation plays a crucial role in traditional organisations. Specialisation allows organisations to maximise efficiency and effectiveness and thus increase productivity overall. All specialised positions, from Gardners to rocket scientists, do their best work when they are adequately compensated for their time and efforts. We believe that this Recognized delegates program will assist the DAO in reducing its collective cost of governance while improving efficiency and direction.</p><h2>Specification</h2><p><strong>What is a Recognized delegate?</strong></p><p>A recognised delegate is an elected, paid position of reputable, diligent and qualified 1inch DAO members who will work closely with the team and contribute to the growth and sustainability of the 1inchDAO</p><p><strong>Eligibility:</strong></p><p>Have a minimum 500,000 in voting weight and a maximum of 250,000 in self delegation</p><p>Contribute to forum conversations for 3 months</p><p>Post a public link with an audio recording where the delegates communicate their vision and values.</p><p>Get accepted as Recognized delegates by following the process below:</p><p><strong>Framework for Delegates to become recognized delegates</strong></p><p>At the beginning of the engagement, each delegate posts their goals and plans for the 6 month engagement with the DAO with clear KPIs.If the proposal is approved, then the DAO will accept the delegates as recognized delegates and hold them accountable to the listed KPIs</p><p>The delegate has to communicate their work at the end of the engagement with a report posted on the forum.</p><p><strong>Responsibilities:</strong></p><p>Read, understand, and provide feedback on governance forum posts if necessary.</p><p>Always vote in the best interests of the DAO and the community over their personal interests.</p><p>Actively vote on governance proposals and explain the thinking behind each vote when relevant.</p><p>Understand the 1inch Network, its key metrics and the overall ecosystem.</p><p><strong>Compensation:</strong></p><p>This Recognised Delegates Programme trial program aims to attract and retain entities and individuals who will actively participate in governance on behalf of 1inch token-holders as governance specialists. Hence we suggest compensating the delegates based on minimum participation and performance.</p><p><strong>Fixed Compensation:</strong></p><p>All recognised delegates meeting the minimum eligibility criteria will receive $4000 in USDC each month.</p><p><strong>Fixed comp eligibility:</strong></p><p>Minimum Participation: A delegate must maintain at least an 80% participation rate. Participation is measured as voting in any “temperature check” or on-chain governance vote.</p><p>Minimum Communication: A delegate must maintain an 80% communication rate. Communication is measured as providing for any “temperature check” or on-chain governance vote a summary, voting position, and justification for that position. A missed vote will still require communication to avoid a lower communication rate.</p><p>Minimum Delegation Threshold: To remain eligible for delegate incentives, a delegate must maintain the voting weight of at least 500K 1inch tokens.</p><h2>Rationale</h2><p>Delegation and compensation mechanisms vary across the DAO ecosystem. Some DAOs such as Maker, OP, and Hop compensate delegates as a % of their voting power, participation, and minimums. We believe that this motivates delegates to accumulate more voting power instead of focusing on positive governance practices in the DAO. Hence we suggest a minimum delegation and participation threshold to qualify for governance rewards.</p><p>Based on delegation examples in traditional organisations, we believe that this methodology offers the best results for the DAO in the short to mid-term, given its current maturity and contributor engagement. We acknowledge that crypto is a fast-evolving space, and the ecosystem may arrive at better governance mechanisms than delegation in the future.</p><h2>Considerations</h2><p>The 1inchDAO should consider building a reputation dashboard so that anyone can track delegates&#x27; voting history and performance. A platform such as tally.xyz can also make it easy for potential delegators to delegate their tokens.</p><p>In terms of budget, we suggest setting aside 100,000 USDC for the pilot. We suggest using a separate operations multi-sig to administer these expenses. Any unused funds should be returned back to the DAO after the end of the trial period.</p></div></div></div><a class="sc-dGHKFW bNNvsL">Show Less...</a></div></div></div></details></div></div></details><details class="details_2Ziz alert alert--info details_1VDD" data-collapsed="true"><summary><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h3 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="1ip-28-discontinue-swap-surplus-collection"></a>[1IP-28] Discontinue Swap Surplus Collection<a class="hash-link" href="#1ip-28-discontinue-swap-surplus-collection" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3></summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_3OHp"><div><u><ul><li><p><strong><a href="https://gov.1inch.io/discussion/11470-1ip28-discontinue-swap-surplus-collection" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phase-3: Temperature Check</a></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://snapshot.org/#/1inch.eth/proposal/0x62888ad3983a8bdb29e73596b4971a120e6d58ca56929b4a64147a723f6bccc5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phase-4: Snapshot Vote</a></strong></p></li></ul></u></div><details class="details_2Ziz alert alert--info details_1VDD" data-collapsed="true"><summary><p><strong>Full Proposal Description</strong></p></summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_3OHp"><div class="sc-ivmvlL hCiYTB"><div class="sc-jWquRx kABXJY"><div><div class="sc-jclSIp hmA-DnJ"><p><strong>Author: RoundElephant.eth</strong></p><h2>References</h2><p><a href="https://help.1inch.io/en/articles/5583703-what-is-a-swap-surplus-and-where-does-it-end-up-when-my-swap-is-completed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What is a swap &#x27;surplus&#x27;, and where does it end up when my swap is completed? | 1inch.io</a></p><p><a href="https://docs.1inch.io/docs/governance/dao-treasury#revenue-stream" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revenue stream | 1inch Network docs</a></p><h2>Simple Summary</h2><p>Discontinue Swap Surplus collection to provide a more consistent user experience.</p><p>Positive slippage will instead be redirected back to the user.</p><h2>Abstract</h2><p>This proposal calls for discontinuing the collection of the Swap Surplus (also called positive slippage). Swap Surplus has been highly inconsistent as a revenue stream and can negatively impact a minority of users.</p><p>By prioritizing user experience and long-term growth, the 1inch Network aims to increase its market share and explore alternative revenue streams like the resolver fee mechanism of Fusion Mode. If passed, would-be Swap Surplus funds will be automatically redirected users with the ultimate goal of increasing user satisfaction and promoting the long-term success of the 1inch Network.</p><h2>Motivation</h2><p>The primary motivation behind this proposal is to enhance user experience on the 1inch platform.</p><p>For the DAO, the Swap Surplus revenue stream has proven to be highly inconsistent over time, with monthly collections varying significantly. In December 2021, revenue collection was approximately $2 million per month, but in recent months, it has dwindled to a few hundred thousand.</p><p>For users, the Swap Surplus collection has led to unpredictability. Though the vast majority of trades are not impacted by Swap Surplus, a small minority have experienced reduced returns of up to 10%. By discontinuing the collection of Swap Surplus revenue, we aim to create a more consistent trading experience for all users.</p><h2>Specification</h2><p>This proposal serves as a signal from the 1inch Network DAO to 1inch Labs. Once passed, the 1inch DAO calls for 1inch Labs to make the following changes to the protocol backend:</p><ul><li>Discontinue the collection of Swap Surplus revenue within the 1inch Aggregation Protocol.</li><li>Automatically reroute any Swap Surplus funds back to the user during the swap process.</li></ul><h2>Rationale</h2><p>Calling for the discontinuation of Swap Surplus revenue collection is based on the belief that prioritizing user experience and long-term growth will ultimately yield greater benefits for the 1inch Network. With the revenue stream being highly inconsistent and its impact on users varying greatly, the potential drawbacks of continuing to collect Swap Surplus outweigh the benefits.</p><p>Furthermore, the introduction of Fusion Mode opens the door for alternative revenue streams that can be more consistent and less controversial. By focusing on these new opportunities, the 1inch Network can work towards increasing its market share and ensuring a more robust and sustainable revenue model.</p><h2>Considerations</h2><h3>Security</h3><p>The proposed changes do not pose any significant security risks, as they primarily involve altering the distribution of surplus funds. By rerouting these funds back to the user, the platform remains secure and transparent, with no additional vulnerabilities introduced.</p><h3>Governance</h3><p>In the short term, this proposal will mean a complete cessation of revenue being collected by the DAO treasury. However, by focusing on long-term growth and user satisfaction, the 1inch Network can strengthen its position in the market, potentially leading to increased revenue in the future.</p></div></div></div><a class="sc-dGHKFW bNNvsL">Show Less...</a></div></div></div></details></div></div></details><details class="details_2Ziz alert alert--info details_1VDD" data-collapsed="true"><summary><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h3 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="1ip-27-allocate-1m-usdc-stables-in-treasury-to-lending-pool-on-aave-v3"></a>[1IP-27] Allocate 1M USDC stables in treasury to lending pool on AAVE V3<a class="hash-link" href="#1ip-27-allocate-1m-usdc-stables-in-treasury-to-lending-pool-on-aave-v3" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3></summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_3OHp"><div><u><ul><li><p><strong><a href="https://gov.1inch.io/discussion/9310-1ip-27-allocate-1m-usdc-stables-in-treasury-to-lending-pool-on-aave-v3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phase-3: Temperature Check</a></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://snapshot.org/#/1inch.eth/proposal/0x3f0f0b21f2841698f5919246fc0a1e6d4f952a46504cae228c98974316878e66" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phase-4: Snapshot Vote</a></strong></p></li></ul></u></div><details class="details_2Ziz alert alert--info details_1VDD" data-collapsed="true"><summary><p><strong>Full Proposal Description</strong></p></summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_3OHp"><div class="sc-ivmvlL hCiYTB"><div class="sc-jWquRx kABXJY"><div><div class="sc-jclSIp hmA-DnJ"><p><strong>Author: @DAOplomats.eth  (@Baer, @jengajojo)</strong></p><h2>Simple-summary</h2><p>This proposal suggests allocating 1M USDC of the current USDC balance into AAVE V3 to generate passive yield.</p><h2>Motivation</h2><p>~95% of the current 1inch DAO treasury is in USDC, earning exactly 0% interest or fees. The only source of income is the 1inch DEX. At the same time, there is ~15.5M USDC which could potentially generate income for the DAO with relatively low risk. The current average variable yield in AAVE markets is between 1-2%</p><h2>Specification</h2><p><strong>What is lending and borrowing?</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTp9er6S73M" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTp9er6S73M</a></p><h2>AAVE V3</h2><p>Aave is a decentralised non-custodial liquidity protocol where users can participate as depositors or borrowers. Depositors provide liquidity to the market to earn a passive income, while borrowers can borrow in an overcollateralized (perpetually) or undercollateralized (one-block liquidity) fashion.</p><h2>Expected Yield</h2><p>The current average variable yield in both markets is between 1-2%, which means that the DAO can potentially earn between ~ 6000 &amp; ~12000 USDC per month.</p><p><strong>Update (13.05.23) :Current  yield in Aave is more than 3%</strong></p><h2>Why AAVE?</h2><p>The AAVE team has been building since 2017 and the contracts have hosted one of the highest TVLs in DeFi at the moment. This makes depositing in AAVE V3 relatively less risky than any other lending/borrowing protocol.</p><h2>Considerations</h2><p>There are several ways to earn a yield on idel treasury assets such as:</p><p><strong>Yield Farming on yield aggregators such as Yearn.Finance</strong></p><p>In this approach, tokens are deposited into contracts which run the best risk-adjusted farming strategies to earn native tokens, which are swapped back to the original token. This strategy’s upside is that yield is farmed automatically and is independent of market activity; however, this comes with slightly higher smart contract risks than the other two options. Another con here is that the Yearn.finance team is completely anonymous, which can be considered a con in some cases</p><p><strong>Being a liquidity provider on DEXes</strong></p><p>As highlighted in the Stablenode proposal, being a liquidity provider for the native token has several advantages and disadvantages. Since this strategy is already being proposed in another RFC we won’t dive into the details here. The only con we see here is that to provide a significant proportion of the treasury to LPing would mean taking on losses in the form of slippage on top of the risks mentioned in the proposal.</p><h2>Depositing into a Lending pool</h2><p>Based on the analysis provided in this proposal, we suggest that depositing in lending pools is the best risk-adjusted strategy for a large treasury allocation. In the current approach, there is no need to do any other complicated swap resulting in slippage or engaging in unnecessary smart contract risks.</p><h2>Risks and Disclaimers:</h2><p>AAVE  Audit

contract. These tokens are held by backers, advisors, and core contributors. Redeeming fully-vested v1INCH for the underlying 1INCH is a manual action that must be taken by the holder.</p><p>Currently, all v1INCH, no matter where it is along its vesting contract, has a flat 20% weighting compared to st1INCH. This proposal calls for a treatment of v1INCH similarly to that of st1INCH(v2) – v1INCH will have more voting power if there is more time remaining on the vesting schedule (with a 2-year maximum). Here is a breakdown of how the voting weight will change according to the unlock schedule:</p><ul><li><p>1-year cliff to full unlock: 22% voting power</p></li><li><p>1.5-year cliff to full unlock: 47% voting power</p></li><li><p>2-year cliff to full unlock: 100% voting power</p></li><li><p>3-year cliff to full unlock: 100% voting power</p></li><li><p>4-year cliff to full unlock: 100% voting power</p></li></ul><p><strong>Example 1</strong></p><ul><li><p>Address: 0x812D157dd6CF4aAc6bEfcEd2CE92B725cBEEc39A</p></li><li><p>v1INCH balance: 37.5M (only 12.5M is locked until June, everything else is fully vested and claimable)</p></li><li><p>VotingPower:</p><ul><li><p>Current scheme = 7.5M votes</p></li><li><p>New scheme = 1.73M votes</p></li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Example 2</strong></p><ul><li><p>Address: 0xf2d10DBFB999cF85b0D0a81c9ae70fde5B80310f</p></li><li><p>v1INCH balance: 250K</p></li><li><p>VotingPower:</p><ul><li><p>Current scheme = 50K votes</p></li><li><p>New scheme = 17K votes</p></li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Example 3</strong></p><ul><li><p>Address: 0x317E1b409C0809f0Dd56b8Fb84185e2982106287</p></li><li><p>v1INCH balance: 8.57M (everything is locked)</p></li><li><p>VotingPower:</p><ul><li><p>Current scheme = 1.71M votes</p></li><li><p>New scheme = 2.49M votes</p></li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Example 4</strong></p><ul><li><p>Address: 0x03429fA2D2Ba986D5b9F619c616fE4077a297B98</p></li><li><p>v1INCH balance: 500K</p></li><li><p>VotingPower:</p><ul><li><p>Current scheme = 100K votes</p></li><li><p>New scheme = 276K votes</p></li></ul></li></ul><h2>Snapshot</h2><p>The <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/1inch.eth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1inch Network Snapshot space</a>, and the<a href="https://snapshot.org/#/signaling.1inch.eth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> 1inch DAO Fast-Track Signaling Subspace</a>, will be updated with the following changes:</p><ul><li><p>Remove st1INCH (v1) voting and delegation strategies</p></li><li><p>Replace existing st1INCH(v2) strategy with one that uses <code>Unicorn Power</code> instead <code>erc20-balance-of</code>.</p></li><li><p>Remove the existing 20% weighted v1INCH strategy</p></li><li><p>Add a new voting-power-weighted strategy for v1INCH using this contract: <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xfb7246c98b6e6c8529c06359b237566e5bc4677c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VestedVotingPower | Address 0xfB7246C98B6e6C8529c06359B237566e5Bc4677C | Etherscan</a></p><ul><li><p>This contract gives onchain mapping for the appropriate vesting contract of each v1INCH holder.</p></li><li><p>This is an onchain expression of the logic described in the previous section.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Change the proposal validation strategy to require 100,000 Voting Weight when creating a new proposal.</p></li></ul><h3>Token Contracts</h3><ul><li><p>v1INCH: <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x03d1b1a56708fa298198dd5e23651a29b76a16d2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">0x03d1b1a56708fa298198dd5e23651a29b76a16d2</a></p></li><li><p>st1INCH (v2): <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x9a0c8ff858d273f57072d714bca7411d717501d7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">0x9A0C8Ff858d273f57072D714bca7411D717501D7</a></p></li><li><p>st1INCH (legacy): <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0xa0446d8804611944f1b527ecd37d7dcbe442caba" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">0xA0446D8804611944F1B527eCD37d7dcbE442caba</a></p></li></ul><header><h1>Rationale</h1></header><p>Onchain mapping of vesting contracts to each v1INCH holder was a prerequisite for this proposal as there was no other way of determining if a holder’s v1INCH tokens were fully unvested, partially vested, or fully vested.

Fast-track proposals will have a lifecycle of 72 hours due to the nature of the proposal.</p><h2>Abstract</h2><p>As 1inch DAO further decentralizes, a fast-track process will be necessary to address emergencies. These fast-track proposals will enable the DAO to take immediate action; instead of relying on the standard governance process.<br>1IP-XX outlines the domains or situations that permit a fast-track proposal and its scope to prevent malicious abuse.</p><h2>Motivation</h2><h2>Motivation</h2><p>There will be emergencies where we will need to perform an urgent vote for the sake of the DAO. The existing <a href="https://docs.1inch.io/docs/governance/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Snapshot + Safesnap proposal lifecycle</a> takes a minimum of 18 days, which makes rapid responses impossible.</p><h4>Specification</h4><ol><li>Fast-track process</li><li>Scope of the fast-track process</li><li>Governance Council</li></ol><h4>Fast-track Process</h4><ol><li> Governance Thread for 24 hours</li><li> Snapshot Vote for 48 hours</li></ol><p>Implementing a fast-track proposal would decrease the time to pass a proposal from 8 days to 3 days.</p><p>To indicate a fast-track proposal, community members will have to insert “[Fast-Track]” into the title of a proposal i.e., “[Fast-Track] 1IP-20: Deploy 1INCH on BASE”. This is to alert community members about the nature of the proposal. This will also introduce a new tag to the 1inch forum, “Fast-Track” to keep track of all fast-track proposals.</p><h4>Scope of the fast-track process</h4><p>This process can be utilized under the following circumstances.</p><ol><li>Deploying 1INCH on new networks</li><li>Changes to the Governance Process i.e. Adding abstain, raising or decreasing quorum, adding a new gov process.</li><li>Changes surrounding the 1inch resolver</li></ol><h4>Whitelisted addresses</h4><p>Due to the low governance participation in 1inch DAO, introducing a fast-track process can open the DAO to certain vulnerabilities. Malicious actors can take advantage of the fast-track process, so we recommend forming a public list of whitelisted addresses that are allowed to propose fast-track proposals.<br>These addresses/individuals will be on the forums.<br>We believe that the following community members should be on the initial whitelist:</p><ul><li>RoundElephant:0x824732D3F4Eb94a20254cca9DE10485Ce445Bb40</li><li>Natalia: 0x94B85505Dd701f522cDA4F1e7Ea4bA855eef24bf</li><li>StableLab: 0xea172676E4105e92Cc52DBf45fD93b274eC96676</li><li>DAOplomats: <a href="https://gov.1inch.io/discussion/Dmat-defi.pod.xyz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dmat-defi.pod.xyz</a></li></ul><p>Due to its swift nature, these votes could go unnoticed; therefore, we must have a fast-track whitelist in place to prevent damaging behavior.</p><h4>How to add whitelisted addresses:</h4><p>For a new address to be whitelisted, an already whitelisted address must nominate the new addresses. This nomination would be done in a forum post, and subsequently, go through the 1inch DAO Governance Process, and finally go to a governance vote to determine if the address or addresses should be whitelisted.</p><h4>SnapShot Subspace</h4><p>To facilitate the fast-track process, 1inch DAO will need to set up a separate snapshot subspace. This is necessary because this snapshot currently does not allow for different lengths for different proposals. <br>The newly created snapshot subspace would have a shorter voting period of 2 days.</p><h4>Implementation</h4><p>This is how the fast-track proposal would look in practice:</p><ol><li>Whitelisted member post a fast-track proposal on the 1inch forum with “[Fast-Track]” in the title</li><li>Any non-whitelisted members who post a fast-track proposal to Snapshot, will have their proposals taken down.</li><li>After 24 hours, it will move forward to SnapShot.</li><li>1inch token holders will now vote on a proposal via SnapShot.</li></ol><h2>Rationale</h2><p>Every DAO needs a fast-track proposal process to cater to processes which require timely intervention; 1inch’s Governance process would require a large amount of time from discussion to voting duration to cater to an emergency. As the 1inch protocol decentralizes, the community needs this fast-track process to address time-sensitive emergencies.</p></div></div></details></div></div></details><details class="details_2Ziz alert alert--info details_1VDD" data-collapsed="true"><summary><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h3 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="1ip-19-increase-the-number-of-whitelisted-fusion-mode-resolver-to-10"></a>[1IP-19] Increase the Number of Whitelisted Fusion Mode Resolver to 10<a class="hash-link" href="#1ip-19-increase-the-number-of-whitelisted-fusion-mode-resolver-to-10" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3></summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_3OHp"><div><u><ul><li><p><strong><a href="https://gov.1inch.io/discussion/10259-1ip19-increase-the-number-of-whitelisted-fusion-mode-resolver-to-10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phase-3: Temperature Check</a></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://snapshot.org/#/1inch.eth/proposal/0x4b16ca79084d3e25768c8d419943624c0dec6865be359855687c532342e87b86" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phase-4: Snapshot Vote</a></strong></p></li></ul></u></div><details class="details_2Ziz alert alert--info details_1VDD" data-collapsed="true"><summary><p><strong>Full Proposal Description</strong></p></summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_3OHp"><p><strong>Author:</strong> <a href="/1inch/account/0x824732D3F4Eb94a20254cca9DE10485Ce445Bb40">@RoundElephant</a></p><p><strong>Phase-1 Discussion:</strong> <a href="https://gov.1inch.io/discussion/10206-increase-numeber-of-whilisted-resolvers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Increase Number of Whilisted Resolvers</a></p><hr><header><h1>Simple Summary</h1></header><p>This proposal seeks to increase the number of whitelisted resolvers in 1inch Fusion mode from five (5) to ten (10).</p><header><h1>Abstract</h1></header><p>If passed, this proposal will expand the 1inch Fusion mode resolver whitelist to ten (currently five).

Due to technical limitations, Dune does not allow surfacing per-user information and does not provide useful search features. Also, in general, Dune dashboards have a hard time getting the reach they deserve.

This donation is intended to help save the lives of the victims who are facing severe shortages of food, shelter, medical supplies, clean water access, electricity supply disruption etc., due to extensive damage caused by these earthquakes.</p><p>The donation will be split equally between Anka and BanklessDAO Turkey Disaster Relief Fund -- both projects have been vetted by the Ethereum community and the author.</p><p><strong>Motivation</strong></p><p>This proposal seeks to express solidarity with those affected by this tragedy while also providing tangible support for ongoing relief efforts being carried out by non-profit organizations.</p><p>By donating funds directly to these non-profits we can ensure our contribution will be used effectively where it matters most -- supporting people impacted across Turkiye.</p><p><strong>BanklessDAO Turkey Disaster Relief Fund</strong> is focused on humanitarian relief for those impacted by the earthquakes.

Active governance means that the community is dedicated to improving the protocol’s operations, which builds a culture of iteration around the protocol. However, governance work is continuously under or unpaid, making it an unattractive role.</p><p>By incentivizing an active governance culture at 1inch, we can attract participants to become more involved in 1inch DAO, thus enabling more opportunities for 1INCH to decentralize. 1INCH DAO tried a similar program last year using<a href="https://beta.layer3.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Layer 3</a>, which was successful in attracting participants.</p><h2>Specification</h2><p>Contents</p><ol><li><p>Aims</p></li><li><p>Allocation</p></li><li><p>Eligibility</p></li><li><p>Eligible Proposals</p></li><li><p>Ineligible Proposals</p></li><li><p>Eligible Recipients</p></li><li><p>Distribution</p></li><li><p>Administration</p></li><li><p>Accountability</p></li><li><p>Reflection</p></li></ol><h3>Aims</h3><p>1INCH governance is still somewhat inactive, and in these current market conditions, it is even harder to attract governance participation. We hope some form of incentive will attract users to engage with the 1inch DAO.</p><p>We would like to present this program for 6 months at a total cost of 6,000 USDC.</p><h3>Allocation</h3><p>This proposal would allocate 6,000 USDC to a newly-made community multi-sig. Each successful proposal would receive 500 USDC.  At the end of each month, the community multi-sig will distribute rewards to the eligible authors. This is to reduce the unnecessary cost to the DAO.</p><p>This would incentivize a total of 12 proposals across 6 months.</p><p>Since 1INCH earns protocol revenue in USDC, it is easier to distribute governance rewards in USDC. If all USDC is distributed, this would cost the DAO 6,000 USDC for 6 months.</p><h3>Eligibility</h3><h3>Eligible Proposals</h3><p>All proposals that follow the outlined <a href="https://gov.1inch.io/t/1inch-dao-governance-process/1973" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">governance workflow</a> within 1inch DAO and successfully pass Phase 4.</p><h3>Ineligible Proposals</h3><ol><li><p>Proposals requesting budgets or grants are excluded.</p></li><li><p>Grants are directed to the current <a href="https://1inch.io/foundation-grant-program/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1inch grant program</a>.</p></li><li><p>Proposals making minimal amendments to previous proposals (e.g. fixing only typos) are excluded from this program.</p></li><li><p>Proposals that have no direct, actionable outcome (e.g. establishing a mission statement) are excluded from this program.</p></li></ol><h3>Eligible Recipients</h3><p>The original authors of a proposal are considered the eligible recipients of the reward. Those who initiate the Snapshot vote will not be eligible for a reward. If there are multiple authors of a proposal, it will be assumed that the reward will be evenly split unless explicitly stated otherwise to the community multi-sig disbursers.</p><h3>Multi-sig</h3><p>Multi-sig address: 0x45e84e10e8E85c583C002A40007D10629EF80fAF</p><p>Stablelab: 0xea172676E4105e92Cc52DBf45fD93b274eC96676</p><p>DAOPlaomats: 0x7C2A118717Acf3C821C584506FA5a080cfa6105C</p><p>RoundElephant: 0x824732D3F4Eb94a20254cca9DE10485Ce445Bb40</p><p>Natalia: 0x94B85505Dd701f522cDA4F1e7Ea4bA855eef24bf</p><h3>Distribution</h3><p><a href="https://gov.1inch.io/u/roundelephant" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@RoundElephant</a> , Natalia, StableLab and <a href="https://gov.1inch.io/u/daoplomats.eth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@DAOplomats.eth</a> can form the newly made community multi-sig for these community incentives with a 2/4 signature.</p><p>Multi-Sig Address: 0x45e84e10e8E85c583C002A40007D10629EF80fAF</p><p>Authors of a proposal should communicate with community multi-sig signers to provide the correct wallet information for distribution.

This system can be limiting as it does not allow members to express their opinions accurately, particularly if they are unsure of the consequences of a proposal or do not have enough information to make a decision. Adding an Abstain option to the voting process will allow members to express their views more accurately and increase the overall transparency of the governance process.</p><p>Specification</p><p>Under the current governance process, the voting options are limited to ‘Yes’ or ‘No’</p><p>If this proposal is successfully implemented, the following changes will be reflected.</p><p>image</p><p>Proposed Changes</p><p>|| During this period, addresses with voting power may vote for, against or abstain from voting on the proposal using the same three voting options as the Phase-3 poll:</p><p>(Yes) In favour of this proposal.</p><p>(No) Against this proposal.||</p><p>(Abstain) Neither In favour nor Against</p><p>The Abstain Button is expected to be used in the following cases</p><p>Neutrality: The Abstain option allows members to remain neutral on a proposal and not take a stance, which can be useful when members are unsure of the proposal&#x27;s consequences or do not have enough information to decide
Higher Conflict of interest: As part of proposal hygiene, Authors of the proposals tend to abstain from voting on their proposals even though they act in the best interest of the DAO. Furthermore, Voters tend to abstain from voting if there is a high conflict of interests as a voter and the proposed implications.
Insufficient information: In case a proposal is moved to snapshot with insufficient information or data, a voter can choose to abstain, thus signalling their unwillingness to decide without further information or discussion
The proposed changes will impact any existing quorums or the requirement to pass a proposal.</p><p>Rationale</p><p>This proposal aims to encourage members to participate in the voting process, which may have otherwise not participated due to a lack of clear stance on a proposal.</p><p>Considerations</p><p>There are no security implications with this proposal.</p><p>Once passed, the 1IPs should include ‘Abstain’ as a voting option</p><p>The Governance Doc of 1inch DAO should be updated through a GitHub pull request to update the changes</p></div></div></div></details></div></div></details><details class="details_2Ziz alert alert--info details_1VDD" data-collapsed="true"><summary><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h3 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="1ip-14-update-1inch-dao-voting-process-to-include-st1inchv2"></a>[1IP-14] Update 1inch DAO Voting Process to Include st1INCH(v2)<a class="hash-link" href="#1ip-14-update-1inch-dao-voting-process-to-include-st1inchv2" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3></summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_3OHp"><div><u><ul><li><p><strong><a href="https://gov.1inch.io/discussion/9710-1ip14-update-1inch-dao-voting-process-to-include-st1inchv2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phase-3: Temperature Check</a></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://snapshot.org/#/1inch.eth/proposal/0x130dd7505f863786fa378f041b018342511974524c0de4c9b79fdf95da9df3ae" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phase-4: Snapshot Vote</a></strong></p></li></ul></u></div><details class="details_2Ziz alert alert--info details_1VDD" data-collapsed="true"><summary><p><strong>Full Proposal Description</strong></p></summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_3OHp"><div class="sc-jWquRx kPnoKB"><h2>Simple Summary</h2><p>This proposal seeks to modify the 1inch DAO governance process to allow st1INCH(v2) holders to vote on 1inch DAO Snapshot proposals.</p><h2>Abstract</h2><p>If passed, this proposal will allow st1INCH(v2) holders to participate in 1inch DAO Snapshot votes.</p><p>Legacy st1INCH and v1INCH will have unchanged voting weights.</p><h2>Motivation</h2><p>With the passing of <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/1inch.eth/proposal/0xece08908c3e10e5125557bc52caac70e5cdc862c391bf02f870da9d1bcc40542" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[1IP-11] 1inch Staking Pods</a>, and the subsequent launch of 1inch Fusion mode, st1INCH(v2) has become the primary utility token of 1inch Network.

This system will consist of:</p><ul><li>Incentivised time-locked 1INCH staking</li><li>Permissionless delegation pods</li><li>Reward distribution compatibility</li><li>50% of all current, and future, 1inch DAO protocol revenue shall be distributed to stakers</li></ul><h2>Abstract</h2><p>With the Staking Pod system, users lock their 1INCH tokens in a staking contract to get st1INCH tokens — the longer the lock period, the more st1INCH tokens the user gets. st1INCH tokens can be used by stakers for 1inch DAO governance, and the 1inch DAO can choose to use these token balances for reward distribution. The system is modular as anyone can launch a new Modular Delegation Pod and can use the reward functionality to incentivize certain actions and/or assign utility to the 1INCH token. 50% of all current, and future, 1inch DAO revenue shall be distributed to stakers.</p><h2>Motivation</h2><p>1INCH token is the governance token of the 1inch Network. It provides voting rights within the 1inch DAO’s governance system, and users can stake it to receive a <a href="https://blog.1inch.io/the-extended-gas-refund-program-is-now-available-to-yet-more-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">refund 3</a> on their transaction fees. However, despite these functions, the amount of 1INCH tokens currently being held in <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0xa0446d8804611944f1b527ecd37d7dcbe442caba" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">staking contracts is quite low</a> and governance participation is even lower. We believe that this is due to a lack of incentives to participate in governance and a lack of additional utility for staked 1INCH.</p><p>By introducing Modular Staking Pods, we hope to give stakers more direct control over how their stake is used to power the 1inch Network. This change will allow them to independently select how their stake governs each of the protocols and will allow for rewards to permissionlessly be distributed based on the actions of the stakers. We envision that this will improve the goverance by aligning incentives between people who want to stake to earn rewards and those who are interested in protocol governance – both players will have direct incentives to participate in the same system.</p><p>We believe that this proposal represents a step forward for the 1inch Network and that it will help increase adoption and usage of the network’s future protocols.</p><h2>Specification</h2><h3>Staking</h3><p>Like the existing 1INCH staking contract, users will be able to lock their 1INCH tokens in the staking contract to get st1INCH tokens that can be used for 1inch DAO governance. However, unlike the current system, Modular Staking will require users to lock their 1INCH for a set amount of time.</p><h3>Locking</h3><p>The minimum and maximum lock periods are chosen by the DAO through — for the purposes of analysis, we’ll use 1 month and 2 years as the minimum and maximum staking periods respectively. st1INCH tokens grant users “voting power” which they can use for various use cases. The longer the locking period the more “voting power” resolver can get. However, the increase in power is not linear.</p><p>There will be a minimum locking period of 1 month.</p><p>Note that st1INCH voting power will decay over time according to the locking curve. Also note that users can re-lock their stake at any time to refresh their st1INCH balance. Users will be able to withdraw their stake early but will forfeit a portion of their rewards.</p><p>Orange is the amount lost when a staker withdraws earlier than they originally committed.</p><p>Example:</p><ul><li><p>In 2023, Sally stakes 100 1INCH and selects a 2-year lock period.</p></li><li><p>They receive 100 st1INCH from the staking contract and this balance decays over time.</p></li><li><p>By 2024 Sally’s st1INCH balance has decayed to 22.36</p></li><li><p>Sally then chooses to re-lock her stake for the maximum amount of time, 2-years, and her st1INCH balance is increased to 100.</p></li><li><p>Sally chose not to re-lock, and in 2026, after the lock period, she withdraws her original 100 1INCH.</p></li></ul><h3>Unlocking</h3><p>If a st1INCH staker wishes to unlock they will forfeit some of their tokens based on the following equation:</p><p>withdrawalAmount = (balance - votingPower) / 0.9</p><p>penalty = balance - withdrawalAmount</p><p>In this setting, the maximum early withdrawal loss is 90% as the minimum locking period is 1 month</p><h3>Admin Control</h3><p>The 1inch DAO Treasury Address, <a href="https://app.safe.global/balances?safe=eth:0x7951c7ef839e26F63DA87a42C9a87986507f1c07" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">0x7951c7ef839e26F63DA87a42C9a87986507f1c07</a>, would act as admin of the staking contract with control over the following functions:</p><ul><li><p>setFeeReceiver – this would allow the DAO to change the vault to collect the rewards for later distribution between stakers and the DAO treasury.</p></li><li><p>setDefaultFarm – this would allow the DAO to change the default reward distribution contract for 1INCH staking.</p></li><li><p>setMaxLossRatio – this would allow the DAO to change the earliest point at which people can early withdraw their stake by disallowing withdrawals with larger withdrawal fees.</p></li><li><p>setEmergencyExit – This is basically an abort function and would allow the DAO to end the staking scheme. All stakers can reclaim the entire amount of their original stake regardless of their remaining locking period. This would be used if the DAO wanted to migrate to a new staking contract to change key variables, like the maximum lock period.</p></li></ul><h3>Modular Delegation</h3><p>The Modular Delegation system provides users with a set of delegation contracts that are specific to a topic. The set of delegation contracts is permissionless, meaning that anyone can deploy one and allow users to delegate their st1INCH within it.</p><p>The 1inch DAO will have the power to endorse a delegation contract and feature it in the 1inch staking UI.</p><p>For the start, we propose just two delegation topics:</p><p><strong>Snapshot governance delegation</strong></p><ul><li>This will allow users to delegate their Snapshot voting power to a recognized delegate from the UI, or manually enter an Ethereum/ENS address.</li><li>Nested within this is the vanilla<a href="https://docs.snapshot.org/user-guides/delegation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Snapshot space-specific delegation contract 1</a>.</li></ul><p><strong>st1INCH utility delegation</strong></p><ul><li>As part of this staking upgrade, there will be a new protocol added to 1inch’s suite of DeFi tools that will substantially improve the utility of st1INCH.</li><li>Service providers that want to tap into the utility of st1INCH can proposition the community for delegated power.</li></ul><h3>Rewards</h3><p>Modular Staking will have two levels of reward functionality: Generic st1INCH rewards and Modular Delegation rewards.</p><h4>Generic st1INCH rewards</h4><p>The st1INCH contract will allow anyone to run a farm to distribute rewards to everyone holding st1INCH tokens.</p><p>Users also have the ability to to join as many farms as they want as it does not required a user to move their st1inch to a specific farm. Along as a user holds st1inch in their account, they can receive rewards from multiple farms.</p><p>This proposal calls for 50% of all current, and future, 1inch DAO revenue to be distributed to stakers in the form of 1INCH.</p><h4>Modular Delegation rewards</h4><p>Some Modular Delegation contracts have  an integrated rewards function that anyone can run a farm atop.</p><p>The main advantage to this type of reward is that it is not limited to being proportional to a user’s st1INCH holdings. Any action, onchain or offchain, can be used as the basis of reward distribution. This functionality could be used by the 1inch DAO to incentivize anything from editing 1IPs to using a new 1inch protocol (and everything in between).</p><p>Example: The 1inch DAO may use the Snapshot governance delegation contract to incentivize active governance participation by boosting the st1INCH rewards of people who vote on proposals, delegate their st1INCH to active voters, etc…</p><h2>Rationale</h2><p>The rationale for this proposal is to provide a more flexible staking system that can be used to incentivize various activities within the 1inch Network. The new Modular Delegation contracts will allow for rewards to be distributed based on anything from voting on proposals to using new 1inch protocols. This will provide a greater incentive for users to participate in the network and help drive adoption of new 1inch products and services.</p><h2>Considerations</h2><p>The security considerations for this proposal are mainly around the potential for abuse of the new staking and delegation contracts. It is important to ensure that there are adequate safeguards in place to prevent users from delegating their voting power to malicious actors.</p><p>The governance considerations for this proposal include the impact on revenue streams and changes to the governance processes. This proposal could potentially increase revenue for the 1inch DAO if it is successful in incentivizing more users to participate in the network. It is also worth considering how these changes will impact existing voting processes within the 1inch DAO since the existing staking contract will be deprecated.</p></div></div></div></details></div></div></details><details class="details_2Ziz alert alert--info details_1VDD" data-collapsed="true"><summary><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h3 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="1ip-09-collect-1inch-dao-treasury-revenue-in-1inch-token-in-addition-to-usdc"></a>[1IP-09] Collect 1inch DAO Treasury Revenue in 1INCH Token in Addition to USDC<a class="hash-link" href="#1ip-09-collect-1inch-dao-treasury-revenue-in-1inch-token-in-addition-to-usdc" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3></summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_3OHp"><div><u><ul><li><p><strong><a href="https://gov.1inch.io/t/1ip-09-collect-1inch-dao-treasury-revenue-in-1inch-token-in-addition-to-usdc/3292" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phase-3: Temperature Check</a></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://snapshot.org/#/1inch.eth/proposal/0xf232c7f50925954d32f2def1d64d31905346dd96a0fc8bcb6f029d29d0e6208e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phase-4: Snapshot Vote</a></strong></p></li></ul></u></div><details class="details_2Ziz alert alert--info details_1VDD" data-collapsed="true"><summary><p><strong>Full Proposal Description</strong></p></summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_3OHp"><div><div class="sc-gFCZzz gYcqAq"><h2>Simple Summary</h2><p>This proposal seeks to modify the 1inch Network DAO Treasury’s revenue collection strategy by enacting the following changes:</p><ul><li>Switch from buying USDC with Swap Surplus revenue to buying 1INCH when the price is lower than $1.30.</li><li>Switch from buying 1INCH with Swap Surplus revenue to buying USDC the price of 1INCH is greater than or equal to $1.70.</li></ul><h2>Abstract</h2><p>Currently, the Swap Surplus <a href="https://docs.1inch.io/docs/governance/dao-treasury#revenue-stream" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">revenue stream</a> is collected in varying tokens and swapped to <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">USDC</a> before it is then sent to the 1inch DAO <a href="https://app.safe.global/transactions/history?safe=eth:0x7951c7ef839e26F63DA87a42C9a87986507f1c07" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Treasury</a>.

To start the diversification process of the treasury funds, the protocol can keep some incoming Swap Surplus tokens as collected (not swapping them for USDC).</p><p>This proposal aims to whitelist the following tokens for this treasury collection strategy:</p><ul><li>ETH</li><li>WETH</li><li>WBTC</li><li>DAI</li><li>USDT</li></ul><h2>Motivation</h2><p>The 1inch DAO Treasury is 100% composed of USDC. USDC is a fiat-backed stablecoin pegged to USD managed by Circle.</p><p>USD experienced record inflation over the last 12 months, and will experience some degree of inflation for perpetuity.

All other tokens should still be converted to USDC as they are now.</p><h2>Rationale</h2><p>The crypto market cap took a decline in recent months. With token valuations depressed, it may be a good time to start accumulating non-stable tokens to grow the treasury.</p><p>Since exchange transactions cost some Ether to pay for the gas fees, eliminating the swapping step for these whitelisted tokens will increase the capital efficiency of this operation. It is also for this reason that large stable coins such as DAI and USDT, should be sent directly to the treasury.</p><h2>Considerations</h2><p>The current stablecoin composition of the 1inch DAO Treasury ensures that the Treasury is insulated from bearish market cycles. However, this also means the treasury’s funds have no way to keep pace with the rise in inflation. Adding ETH, WETH and WBTC increase both the risk and the potential rewards.</p><p>This proposal does not call for any actions to be taken with the funds currently held by the 1inch DAO Treasury.</p></div></div></div></div></details></div></div></details><details class="details_2Ziz alert alert--info details_1VDD" data-collapsed="true"><summary><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h3 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="1ip-07-integrate-balancer-boosted-pools-in-the-1inch-aggregation-protocol"></a>[1IP-07] Integrate Balancer Boosted Pools in the 1inch Aggregation Protocol<a class="hash-link" href="#1ip-07-integrate-balancer-boosted-pools-in-the-1inch-aggregation-protocol" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3></summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_3OHp"><div><u><ul><li><p><strong><a href="https://gov.1inch.io/t/1inch-balancer-boosted-pools/3012" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phase-3: Temperature Check</a></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://snapshot.org/#/1inch.eth/proposal/0x6358c27cd2d5a95e58095e5cc3b1b9a85d2c9af2a363b259431b53718b26dbb6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phase-4: Snapshot Vote</a></strong></p></li></ul></u></div><details class="details_2Ziz alert alert--info details_1VDD" data-collapsed="true"><summary><p><strong>Full Proposal Description</strong></p></summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_3OHp"><div><div class="sc-eYmodA kEKCYt"><h2>Simple Summary</h2><p>This proposal calls for the integration of <a href="https://docs.balancer.fi/concepts/pools/boosted.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Balancer Boosted Pools</a> into the 1inch Aggregation Protocol.</p><h2>Abstract</h2><p>This proposal aims to grow the kinds of liquidity sources compatible with the 1inch Aggregation Protocol by integrating Balancer Boosted Pools. To fund this development, a BAL grant from Balancer DAO and Balancer DAO will be awarded to 1inch Labs upon the successful completion of the integration. Specifically, the following</p><ol><li>1inch Labs shall integrate the Balancer Boosted Pools into the 1inch smart contracts, the 1inch dApp, and the 1inch API.</li><li>The integration shall be live on the Ethereum main-net no later than 3 weeks after this proposal passes the Phase-4 snapshot vote.</li><li>If both conditions 1 and 2 are met, Balancer DAO and Balancer DAO will transfer 20k BAL or the equivalent in stablecoins (as determined by Balancer DAO) to 1inch Labs.</li></ol><h2>Motivation</h2><p>Balancer Boosted Pools are a new pool type that have been gaining traction from many DeFi protocols. These pools were previously discussed with the 1inch community on the <a href="https://gov.1inch.io/t/1inch-balancer-boosted-pools/3012" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1inch Governance Forum</a> as well as the <a href="https://youtu.be/OQF0wqgQXDg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1inch Network DAO Community Call #02</a>.</p><p>Given that this is a new pool type and requires effort from 1inch Labs, Balancer seeks to fund this integration via a payment of 20,000 BAL to 1inch Labs.</p><h2>Specification</h2><p>At a high level, integration of Balancer Boosted Pools would require support for Balancer’s BatchSwap function, the routing of trades through multiple Balancer pools including linear pools nested in the boosted pool and the math in the linear pools. This proposal hopes that the support for Boosted Pools is general and can later be expanded to new future Boosted Pools. The integration of Balancer’s BatchSwap function within the 1inch Network will also be able to be used for pools other than Boosted Pools which would benefit both the 1inch Network and Balancer as it would allow for cheaper execution of trades from the wider Balancer pool types. In the near future we expect to see meta pools created with the BPT of Boosted Pools, an example would be a bbaUSD/WETH pool. Routing trades through such pools would include one or more extra hop through Balancer’s BatchSwap function.</p><p>We expect that there will be many new Boosted Pools across all networks in near future, namely poos in collaboration with Ampleforth and Olympus although, below is a non-exhaustive list of currently live Boosted Pools on Ethereum L1:</p><ol><li>bbaUSD, containing 300mm of DAI/USDC/USDT TVL</li><li>bbfUSD, <a href="https://tribe.fei.money/t/fip-90-fuse-boosted-usd-balancer-pool-bb-f-usd/4023" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">expected</a> to contain at least 50mm of FEI/LUSD/DAI</li></ol><p>This is contingent on the same proposal passing through the BalancerDAO.</p><p>Upon satisfactory integration <sup><em>Note1</em></sup>, 20,000 BAL shall be sent to 1inch Labs ETH address:</p><p>0x2DF104682A61241C79eBB3ce3b2C293578bF6A9D.</p><p><em>Note 1</em>: Satisfactory integration is defined as the 1inch Aggregation Protocol accurately forwarding trades through the bbaUSD and the bbfUSD pools, on Ethereum main-net, when those pools offer the optimal pricing for the end-user.</p><h2>Rationale</h2><p>Support for the mentioned pools will unlock $350mm of efficient TVL for the 1inch Aggregation Protocol and allow it to have access to cheap liquidity for trade routing at the moment of integration and much more TVL in the future as Boosted Pool continue their adoption. Additionally, Boosted Pools have been adapted by BeethovenX, Balancer’s Friendly Fork on Fantom and, integrating them would provide a good source for volume to 1inch on Fantom as well.</p><p>Balancer Boosted Pools are in much demand from other DeFi protocols due to their innovation in capital efficiency thus, it is expected to see many more Balancer Boosted Pools with high TVL in collaboration with other DAOs, some of which were mentioned in the discussion on the forum. Supporting Boosted Pools will position the 1inch aggregator to be able to rapidly integrate any new Boosted Pools launched.</p><p>This BAL grant would be used by 1inch Labs to fund the development of this integration.</p><h2>Considerations</h2><p>The technical specifics of this integration will be defined by 1inch Labs. Like all new modules they have launched, a complete internal security review and audit should be performed before this change is implemented on main-net.</p><p>Because Balancer DAO is directly funding this integration, other upgrades to the 1inch Network can be made in parallel.</p></div></div></div></div></details></div></div></details><details class="details_2Ziz alert alert--info details_1VDD" data-collapsed="true"><summary><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h3 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="1ip-05-add-derivative-aggregation-to-1inch-network"></a>[1IP-05] Add Derivative Aggregation to 1inch Network<a class="hash-link" href="#1ip-05-add-derivative-aggregation-to-1inch-network" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3></summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_3OHp"><div><u><ul><li><p><strong><a href="https://gov.1inch.io/t/1ip-05-add-derivative-aggregation-to-1inch-network/2828" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phase-3: Temperature Check</a></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://snapshot.org/#/1inch.eth/proposal/0x5f0d629bc534471f9ec7b0d91e86be8eb4c1a3df4e19167976d7985589f90a39" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phase-4: Snapshot Vote</a></strong></p></li></ul></u></div><details class="details_2Ziz alert alert--info details_1VDD" data-collapsed="true"><summary><p><strong>Full Proposal Description</strong></p></summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_3OHp"><div><h2>Simple Summary</h2><p>This proposal seeks to add derivative aggregation to the 1inch Protocol. Specifically, it calls for the following additions:</p><ul><li>Aggregation Protocol is expanded to include derivatives</li><li>Add derivative aggregation to the 1inch smart contracts, 1inch dApp, and 1inch API</li><li>The first derivative supported will be Opium’s TURBO products (call options)</li></ul><h2>Abstract</h2><p>This proposal aims to signal to the 1inch Foundation that the DAO wants to add derivative aggregation to the 1inch Protocol – specifically, the 1inch smart contracts, the 1inch dApp, and the 1inch API. Adding derivative aggregation to the protocol will require technical effort from 1inch Labs, and will require the support of 1inch Foundation.</p><h2>Motivation</h2><p>1inch is currently the leading decentralized exchange aggregator and has made a reputation of providing the best prices on token swaps. With the rise of derivatives in the DeFi space, there is a new product niche that 1inch is perfectly positioned to capitalize on: <strong>the aggregation of derivative products.</strong></p><p>By implementing this proposal, 1inch will solve the problem of fractured derivative liquidity (just like it previously solved fractured token liquidity).</p><h2>Specification</h2><p>This proposal serves as a signal from the 1inch Network DAO to the 1inch Foundation and 1inch Labs. Once passed, the 1inch Network DAO calls for the 1inch Foundation to allot resources to add derivative aggregation to the 1inch Protocol and dApp, and for 1inch Labs to add derivative aggregation to the 1inch smart contracts and 1inch API.</p><p>Opium’s TURBO product is a short-dated call option:</p><ul><li>Community / users can “write” covered calls by pooling their tokens in order to earn yield (collect call option premiums)</li><li>Takers (professional market makers) can buy the call options in order to gain leveraged exposure to the underlying asset</li></ul><p>Adding Opium’s TURBO options to the aggregation UI will require coordination with the Opium community to ensure a smooth integration.</p><h2>Rationale</h2><p>The architecture of the aggregation protocol has not yet been defined.</p><p>Opium’s TURBO product was chosen as the first derivative supported because the Opium community was offering to help with this integration via documentation and SDKs.</p><h2>Considerations</h2><p>The specifics of launching an aggregation protocol will not be defined until the 1inch Foundation supports the proposal. Like all new modules they have launched, a complete security review and audit should be performed before this change is implemented on mainnet.</p><p>Since all work described in this proposal will be organized by the 1inch Foundation, this will not cost any treasury funds.</p></div></div></div></details></div></div></details><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h2 anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="not-passed"></a>Not-Passed<a class="hash-link" href="#not-passed" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>All 1IPs that did not pass the Phase-4 vote.
