**Full Proposal Description**

</summary>

<div>
  <h2>Simple Summary</h2>
  <p>
    This proposal seeks to add derivative aggregation to the 1inch Protocol.
    Specifically, it calls for the following additions:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Aggregation protocol is expanded to include derivatives</li>
    <li>
      Add derivative aggregation to the 1inch smart contracts, 1inch dApp, and
      1inch API
    </li>
    <li>
      The first derivative supported will be Opium’s TURBO products (call
      options)
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>
    This proposal aims to signal to the 1inch Foundation that the DAO wants to
    add derivative aggregation to the 1inch Protocol – specifically, the 1inch
    smart contracts, the 1inch dApp, and the 1inch API. Adding derivative
    aggregation to the protocol will require technical effort from 1inch Labs,
    and will require the support of 1inch Foundation.
  </p>
  <h2>Motivation</h2>
  <p>
    1inch is currently the leading decentralized exchange aggregator and has
    made a reputation of providing the best prices on token swaps. With the rise
    of derivatives in the DeFi space, there is a new product niche that 1inch is
    perfectly positioned to capitalize on:{" "}
    <strong>the aggregation of derivative products.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    By implementing this proposal, 1inch will solve the problem of fractured
    derivative liquidity (just like it previously solved fractured token
    liquidity).
  </p>
  <h2>Specification</h2>
  <p>
    This proposal serves as a signal from the 1inch Network DAO to the 1inch
    Foundation and 1inch Labs. Once passed, the 1inch Network DAO calls for the
    1inch Foundation to allot resources to add derivative aggregation to the
    1inch Protocol and dApp, and for 1inch Labs to add derivative aggregation to
    the 1inch smart contracts and 1inch API.
  </p>
  <p>Opium’s TURBO product is a short-dated call option:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Community / users can “write” covered calls by pooling their tokens in
      order to earn yield (collect call option premiums)
    </li>
    <li>
      Takers (professional market makers) can buy the call options in order to
      gain leveraged exposure to the underlying asset
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Adding Opium’s TURBO options to the aggregation UI will require coordination
    with the Opium community to ensure a smooth integration.
  </p>
  <h2>Rationale</h2>
  <p>The architecture of the aggregation protocol has not yet been defined.</p>
  <p>
    Opium’s TURBO product was chosen as the first derivative supported because
    the Opium community was offering to help with this integration via
    documentation and SDKs.
  </p>
  <h2>Considerations</h2>
  <p>
    The specifics of launching an aggregation protocol will not be defined until
    the 1inch Foundation supports the proposal. Like all new modules they have
    launched, a complete security review and audit should be performed before
    this change is implemented on mainnet.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since all work described in this proposal will be organized by the 1inch
    Foundation, this will not cost any treasury funds.
