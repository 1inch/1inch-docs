                        <h2>Roadmap</h2>
                        <p>In 2022, the Hardware Wallet team received a grant of $175k from the 1inch Foundation to develop an MVP (Minimal Valuable Product) of the hardware wallet. The funds were allocated as follows: 15% for supplies and components required for product design, 72 % for team and contractor costs, and 13% for operational expenses. As a result, the team created a working demo board with core functions, including wallet connection and transactions signing, and documented constructed product design.</p>
                        <p>As of now, we have successfully moved from MVP to EVT1 stage and completed a working engineer prototype. The team is conducting the alpha test and working on device integration into the 1inch Mobile Wallet app.</p>
                        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRwbWE6GfgY">EVT1 Live Demo</a></p>
                        <p>The second and third quarters of 2023 are dedicated to product refinement to the PVT (Product Validation Test, Trade Version), product acceptance, QA and manufacturing, building integrations and partnerships, international laboratory tests & certifications, and setting up sales channels.</p>
                        <h2>Costs</h2>
                        <p>Breakdown of the costs by groups for the project duration (6 months):</p>
                        <ul>

                            <li>Backups & recovery solutions - $75k</li>
                            <li>Development costs, inc. salaries, product management, contractors - $490k</li>
                            <li>Technical performance tests verification and certifications from labs - $110k</li>
                            <li>Security testing and evaluation - $85k</li>
                            <li>Trade licenses, regional policies and legal establishment- $120k</li>
                            <li>Patent registration - $40k</li>
                            <li>Operational costs and corp services - $100k</li>
                            <li>Sales and supply channels configuration- $250k</li>
                            <li>Design, onboarding, community price promos - $95k</li>
                            <li>Partnerships, integrations, business development - $35k</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Total: $2M</p>
                        <h2>Payment structure</h2>
                        <p>We suggest an upfront payment of $2 million to ensure swift progress and timely delivery. This significant initial investment is pivotal for the successful execution of this hardware project. As we have to secure contracts with component providers right from the outset, the upfront capital will be instrumental in negotiating the best prices. We can take advantage of economies of scale and secure cost-effective deals by purchasing higher-quality components.</p>
                        <p>As a start-up company, flexibility is crucial in our operations. Situations may evolve, and adjustments may be required along the way. However, we are fully committed to transparency and accountability in using the funds.</p>
                        <p>We will provide the DAO with comprehensive documentation upon request at any point during our journey. This documentation will detail how funds are utilised, ensuring that every dollar is spent towards delivering a top-quality product for the benefit of 1inch DAO and 1inch ecosystem.</p>
                        <p>We will also update the 1inch DAO on our progress through forum posts, Github and our Telegram channel. In this way, every step we take will be visible, maintaining an open line of communication and transparency throughout the project's development.</p>

                        <h2>Rationale</h2>
                        <p>Our primary motivation for the 1inch hardware wallet development and sales launch is to provide the DeFi community with a secure, user-friendly, and convenient solution to manage their digital assets. An offline, air-gapped solution for private key storage that is built with users and for users, eliminating the risks of online attacks and hacking attempts.</p>

<h2>Simple-summary</h2>
<p>This proposal suggests creating a 6-month trial of a funded Recognised Delegates Programme for 1inchDAO.</p>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The goal of the Recognised Delegates Programme is to reduce the collective cost of governance and increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the governance process in 1inchDAO. To attract, select and retain the best talent, we suggest vetting each Recognised Delegate (group/individual) based on past performance in 1inchDAO and other DAOs and a compensation structure.</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Crypto is speed-running in the history of human coordination. As DAOs evolve from their early idealistic vision to becoming more internet-native organisations, so too must the coordination mechanisms evolve. We have seen that specialisation plays a crucial role in traditional organisations. Specialisation allows organisations to maximise efficiency and effectiveness and thus increase productivity overall. All specialised positions, from Gardners to rocket scientists, do their best work when they are adequately compensated for their time and efforts. We believe that this Recognized delegates program will assist the DAO in reducing its collective cost of governance while improving efficiency and direction.</p>
<h2>Specification</h2>
<p><strong>What is a Recognized delegate?</strong></p>
<p>A recognised delegate is an elected, paid position of reputable, diligent and qualified 1inch DAO members who will work closely with the team and contribute to the growth and sustainability of the 1inchDAO</p>
<p><strong>Eligibility:</strong></p>
<p>Have a minimum 500,000 in voting weight and a maximum of 250,000 in self delegation</p>
<p>Contribute to forum conversations for 3 months</p>
<p>Post a public link with an audio recording where the delegates communicate their vision and values.</p>
<p>Get accepted as Recognized delegates by following the process below:</p>
<p><strong>Framework for Delegates to become recognized delegates</strong></p>
<p>At the beginning of the engagement, each delegate posts their goals and plans for the 6 month engagement with the DAO with clear KPIs.If the proposal is approved, then the DAO will accept the delegates as recognized delegates and hold them accountable to the listed KPIs</p>
<p>The delegate has to communicate their work at the end of the engagement with a report posted on the forum.</p>
<p><strong>Responsibilities:</strong></p>
<p>Read, understand, and provide feedback on governance forum posts if necessary.</p>
<p>Always vote in the best interests of the DAO and the community over their personal interests.</p>
<p>Actively vote on governance proposals and explain the thinking behind each vote when relevant.</p>
<p>Understand the 1inch Network, its key metrics and the overall ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>Compensation:</strong></p>
<p>This Recognised Delegates Programme trial program aims to attract and retain entities and individuals who will actively participate in governance on behalf of 1inch token-holders as governance specialists. Hence we suggest compensating the delegates based on minimum participation and performance.</p>
<p><strong>Fixed Compensation:</strong></p>
<p>All recognised delegates meeting the minimum eligibility criteria will receive $4000 in USDC each month.</p>
<p><strong>Fixed comp eligibility:</strong></p>
<p>Minimum Participation: A delegate must maintain at least an 80% participation rate. Participation is measured as voting in any “temperature check” or on-chain governance vote.</p>
<p>Minimum Communication: A delegate must maintain an 80% communication rate. Communication is measured as providing for any “temperature check” or on-chain governance vote a summary, voting position, and justification for that position. A missed vote will still require communication to avoid a lower communication rate.</p>
<p>Minimum Delegation Threshold: To remain eligible for delegate incentives, a delegate must maintain the voting weight of at least 500K 1inch tokens.</p>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>Delegation and compensation mechanisms vary across the DAO ecosystem. Some DAOs such as Maker, OP, and Hop compensate delegates as a % of their voting power, participation, and minimums. We believe that this motivates delegates to accumulate more voting power instead of focusing on positive governance practices in the DAO. Hence we suggest a minimum delegation and participation threshold to qualify for governance rewards.</p>
<p>Based on delegation examples in traditional organisations, we believe that this methodology offers the best results for the DAO in the short to mid-term, given its current maturity and contributor engagement. We acknowledge that crypto is a fast-evolving space, and the ecosystem may arrive at better governance mechanisms than delegation in the future.</p>
<h2>Considerations</h2>
<p>The 1inchDAO should consider building a reputation dashboard so that anyone can track delegates' voting history and performance. A platform such as tally.xyz can also make it easy for potential delegators to delegate their tokens.</p>
<p>In terms of budget, we suggest setting aside 100,000 USDC for the pilot. We suggest using a separate operations multi-sig to administer these expenses. Any unused funds should be returned back to the DAO after the end of the trial period.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.1inch.io/docs/governance/dao-treasury#revenue-stream">Revenue stream | 1inch Network docs</a></p>

<h2>Simple Summary</h2>

<p>Discontinue Swap Surplus collection to provide a more consistent user experience.</p>
<p>Positive slippage will instead be redirected back to the user.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>This proposal calls for discontinuing the collection of the Swap Surplus (also called positive slippage). Swap Surplus has been highly inconsistent as a revenue stream and can negatively impact a minority of users.</p>

<p>By prioritizing user experience and long-term growth, the 1inch Network aims to increase its market share and explore alternative revenue streams like the resolver fee mechanism of Fusion Mode. If passed, would-be Swap Surplus funds will be automatically redirected users with the ultimate goal of increasing user satisfaction and promoting the long-term success of the 1inch Network.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>The primary motivation behind this proposal is to enhance user experience on the 1inch platform.</p>
<p>For the DAO, the Swap Surplus revenue stream has proven to be highly inconsistent over time, with monthly collections varying significantly. In December 2021, revenue collection was approximately $2 million per month, but in recent months, it has dwindled to a few hundred thousand.</p>
<p>For users, the Swap Surplus collection has led to unpredictability. Though the vast majority of trades are not impacted by Swap Surplus, a small minority have experienced reduced returns of up to 10%. By discontinuing the collection of Swap Surplus revenue, we aim to create a more consistent trading experience for all users.</p>

<h2>Specification</h2>

<p>This proposal serves as a signal from the 1inch Network DAO to 1inch Labs. Once passed, the 1inch DAO calls for 1inch Labs to make the following changes to the protocol backend:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Discontinue the collection of Swap Surplus revenue within the 1inch Aggregation Protocol.</li>
    <li>Automatically reroute any Swap Surplus funds back to the user during the swap process.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Rationale</h2>

<p>Calling for the discontinuation of Swap Surplus revenue collection is based on the belief that prioritizing user experience and long-term growth will ultimately yield greater benefits for the 1inch Network. With the revenue stream being highly inconsistent and its impact on users varying greatly, the potential drawbacks of continuing to collect Swap Surplus outweigh the benefits.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the introduction of Fusion Mode opens the door for alternative revenue streams that can be more consistent and less controversial. By focusing on these new opportunities, the 1inch Network can work towards increasing its market share and ensuring a more robust and sustainable revenue model.</p>

<h2>Considerations</h2>

<h3>Security</h3>

<p>The proposed changes do not pose any significant security risks, as they primarily involve altering the distribution of surplus funds. By rerouting these funds back to the user, the platform remains secure and transparent, with no additional vulnerabilities introduced.</p>

<h3>Governance</h3>

<p>In the short term, this proposal will mean a complete cessation of revenue being collected by the DAO treasury. However, by focusing on long-term growth and user satisfaction, the 1inch Network can strengthen its position in the market, potentially leading to increased revenue in the future.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>~95% of the current 1inch DAO treasury is in USDC, earning exactly 0% interest or fees. The only source of income is the 1inch DEX. At the same time, there is ~15.5M USDC which could potentially generate income for the DAO with relatively low risk. The current average variable yield in AAVE markets is between 1-2%</p>
<h2>Specification</h2>
<p><strong>What is lending and borrowing?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTp9er6S73M" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTp9er6S73M</a></p>
<h2>AAVE V3</h2>
<p>Aave is a decentralised non-custodial liquidity protocol where users can participate as depositors or borrowers. Depositors provide liquidity to the market to earn a passive income, while borrowers can borrow in an overcollateralized (perpetually) or undercollateralized (one-block liquidity) fashion.</p>
<h2>Expected Yield</h2>
<p>The current average variable yield in both markets is between 1-2%, which means that the DAO can potentially earn between ~ 6000 &amp; ~12000 USDC per month.</p>
<p><strong>Update (13.05.23) :Current  yield in Aave is more than 3%</strong></p>
<h2>Why AAVE?</h2>
<p>The AAVE team has been building since 2017 and the contracts have hosted one of the highest TVLs in DeFi at the moment. This makes depositing in AAVE V3 relatively less risky than any other lending/borrowing protocol.</p>
<h2>Considerations</h2>
<p>There are several ways to earn a yield on idel treasury assets such as:</p>
<p><strong>Yield Farming on yield aggregators such as Yearn.Finance</strong></p>
<p>In this approach, tokens are deposited into contracts which run the best risk-adjusted farming strategies to earn native tokens, which are swapped back to the original token. This strategy’s upside is that yield is farmed automatically and is independent of market activity; however, this comes with slightly higher smart contract risks than the other two options. Another con here is that the Yearn.finance team is completely anonymous, which can be considered a con in some cases</p>
<p><strong>Being a liquidity provider on DEXes</strong></p>
<p>As highlighted in the Stablenode proposal, being a liquidity provider for the native token has several advantages and disadvantages. Since this strategy is already being proposed in another RFC we won’t dive into the details here. The only con we see here is that to provide a significant proportion of the treasury to LPing would mean taking on losses in the form of slippage on top of the risks mentioned in the proposal.</p>
<h2>Depositing into a Lending pool</h2>
<p>Based on the analysis provided in this proposal, we suggest that depositing in lending pools is the best risk-adjusted strategy for a large treasury allocation. In the current approach, there is no need to do any other complicated swap resulting in slippage or engaging in unnecessary smart contract risks.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<h1>Simple Summary</h1>
<p>This proposal seeks to modify the 1inch DAO governance process with the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Remove st1INCH(v1) voting and delegation strategies from the 1inch Snapshot space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change the st1INCH(v2) voting and delegation strategy to use Unicorn Power instead of token balance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replace the existing 20% weighted v1INCH strategy with a strategy that emulates the power decay of UnicornPower – i.e., fully vested, and unclaimed, v1INCH, will have greatly diminished voting power. v1INCH that is at the beginning of its vesting contract has full 1:1 voting parity with st1INCH that is at the beginning of a 2-year lock.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase the Snapshot proposal creation requirement to require 100,000 Voting Weight (currenlty 25,000).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>If passed, this proposal will modify the 1inch Network governance process to better reflect staking changes made alongside Fusion mode:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>By removing st1INCH(v1) for the governance process, 1inch Network will fully complete the transition to the new staking contracts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By using Unicorn Power to calculate Voting Weight, instead of token balances, the 1inch DAO governance process is better aligned with the revamped 1INCH staking mechanics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By greatly reducing the voting power of fully vested v1INCH, the DAO will ensure that only those who have a longterm stake in the protocol will be able to make decisions that control 1inch Network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By increasing the proposal creation requirement, we can ensure that proposals which hit the final Snapshot vote already have a non-trivial level of support.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Motivation</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>With the passing of <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/1inch.eth/proposal/0xece08908c3e10e5125557bc52caac70e5cdc862c391bf02f870da9d1bcc40542" target="_blank">[1IP-11] 1inch Staking Pods</a> in December, 2022, the DAO began the transition away from the legacy staking contracts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://snapshot.org/#/1inch.eth/proposal/0x130dd7505f863786fa378f041b018342511974524c0de4c9b79fdf95da9df3ae" target="_blank">[1IP-14] Update 1inch DAO Voting Process to Include st1INCH(v2)</a> put the infrastructure in place to allow the new st1INCH to participate in governance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This proposal marks the full deprecation of st1INCH(v1) as its only remaining utility has been voting on Snapshot proposals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If st1INCH(v1) is never removed from the voting system, it will have an unfair advantage compared to st1INCH(v2) as the latter’s power diminishes over time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is currently over 10 times more st1INCH(v2) staked than st1INCH(v1) ← this shows that there has been enough time for all active participants to migrate.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Specification</h1>
<h2>v1INCH</h2>
<p>v1INCH is the non-transferable ERC-20 token which represents 1INCH tokens that are currently locked in the vesting contract. These tokens are held by backers, advisors, and core contributors. Redeeming fully-vested v1INCH for the underlying 1INCH is a manual action that must be taken by the holder.</p>
<p>Currently, all v1INCH, no matter where it is along its vesting contract, has a flat 20% weighting compared to st1INCH. This proposal calls for a treatment of v1INCH similarly to that of st1INCH(v2) – v1INCH will have more voting power if there is more time remaining on the vesting schedule (with a 2-year maximum). Here is a breakdown of how the voting weight will change according to the unlock schedule:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>1-year cliff to full unlock: 22% voting power</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1.5-year cliff to full unlock: 47% voting power</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2-year cliff to full unlock: 100% voting power</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3-year cliff to full unlock: 100% voting power</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4-year cliff to full unlock: 100% voting power</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Address: 0x812D157dd6CF4aAc6bEfcEd2CE92B725cBEEc39A</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>v1INCH balance: 37.5M (only 12.5M is locked until June, everything else is fully vested and claimable)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>VotingPower:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Current scheme = 7.5M votes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New scheme = 1.73M votes</p>

<h2>Snapshot</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/1inch.eth" target="_blank">1inch Network Snapshot space</a>, and the<a href="https://snapshot.org/#/signaling.1inch.eth" target="_blank"> 1inch DAO Fast-Track Signaling Subspace</a>, will be updated with the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Remove st1INCH (v1) voting and delegation strategies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replace existing st1INCH(v2) strategy with one that uses <code>Unicorn Power</code> instead <code>erc20-balance-of</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove the existing 20% weighted v1INCH strategy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a new voting-power-weighted strategy for v1INCH using this contract: <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xfb7246c98b6e6c8529c06359b237566e5bc4677c" target="_blank">VestedVotingPower | Address 0xfB7246C98B6e6C8529c06359B237566e5Bc4677C | Etherscan</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This contract gives onchain mapping for the appropriate vesting contract of each v1INCH holder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is an onchain expression of the logic described in the previous section.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change the proposal validation strategy to require 100,000 Voting Weight when creating a new proposal.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Token Contracts</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>v1INCH: <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x03d1b1a56708fa298198dd5e23651a29b76a16d2" target="_blank">0x03d1b1a56708fa298198dd5e23651a29b76a16d2</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>st1INCH (v2): <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x9a0c8ff858d273f57072d714bca7411d717501d7" target="_blank">0x9A0C8Ff858d273f57072D714bca7411D717501D7</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>st1INCH (legacy): <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0xa0446d8804611944f1b527ecd37d7dcbe442caba" target="_blank">0xA0446D8804611944F1B527eCD37d7dcbE442caba</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Rationale</h1>
<p>Onchain mapping of vesting contracts to each v1INCH holder was a prerequisite for this proposal as there was no other way of determining if a holder’s v1INCH tokens were fully unvested, partially vested, or fully vested. The 1inch core contributors have deployed the VestedVotingPower smart contract that does this mapping.</p>
<p>It is important to note that st1INCH(v1) holders will still be able to unstake their 1INCH at any point in the future.</p>
<h1>Considerations</h1>
<p>This proposal will have no cost to the 1inch DAO Treasury.</p>
<p>As opposed to st1INCH(v2), st1INCH(v1) does not require a timelock to participate in governance – a bad actor could use this lack of a time-commitment to abuse the 1inch goverance system. This proposal will prevent that as all votes will only be cast by timelocked tokens.</p>
<p>Once passed, the <a href="https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmbNkL7ZpUsP2w7m1bCimkPKqJeSyUxM2K4VkxbaFB8ek5" target="_blank">reality.eth proposal acceptance criteria</a>, and the <a href="https://docs.1inch.io/docs/governance/overview" target="_blank">1inch DAO governance documentation</a>, will need to be updated to reflect the change to v1INCH voting weight and the proposal validation strategy.</p>

<>
  <h3>Author</h3>
  <a href="/profile/id/81421">@RoundElephant</a>

  <h3>Simple Summary</h3>
  <p>
    This proposal calls for the deployment of 1inch Fusion Mode on multiple
    networks, specifically: BNB Chain, Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum, Gnosis,
    Avalanche, Fantom, Klaytn, and Aurora.
  </p>

  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>
    If passed, this proposal calls for 1inch Fusion Mode to be deployed on all
    networks currently supported by 1inch Network. By deploying 1inch Fusion
    Mode on multiple networks, all 1inch users will be able to benefit from the
    UX and pricing improvements, regardless of what chain they are on.
  </p>

  <h3>Motivation</h3>
  <p>
    The deployment of 1inch Fusion Mode on these networks will give all 1inch
    users, on all chains, access to the better pricing offered by 1inch Fusion
    Mode. By allowing users to access 1inch's liquidity aggregation technology
    on these networks, users will benefit from improved liquidity, lower
    slippage, and more competitive pricing.
  </p>
  <p>
    With 1inch Fusion Mode, resolvers pay the gas for the end user – this
    allows users who hold no native fee token in their wallet to still make
    swaps.
  </p>

  <h3>Specification</h3>
  <p>
    This proposal serves as a signal from the 1inch Network DAO to 1inch Labs.
    Once passed, the 1inch DAO calls for 1inch Labs to deploy 1inch Fusion Mode
    on BNB Chain, Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum, Gnosis, Avalanche, Fantom,
    Klaytn, and Aurora.
  </p>

  <h3>Rationale</h3>
  <p>
    By deploying 1inch Fusion Mode on these chains, the 1inch Network will be
    able to increase adoption while also improving the UX for all 1inch users.
  </p>
  <p>
    These deployments will reduce the barriers of entry for users who want the
    best user experience offered by 1inch.
  </p>

  <h3>Considerations</h3>
  <p>
    Deploying 1inch Fusion Mode on multiple networks has no governance
    implications.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is no financial cost to the 1inch DAO, as this proposal is calling
    for the 1inch Foundation to fund the deployment.

      </a>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Simple Summary</h3>
  <p>
    This proposal calls for the deployment of the 1inch Aggregation Protocol,
    1inch Limit Order Protocol, and 1inch Fusion Mode on zkSync Era.
  </p>

  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>
    If passed, this proposal will call for the deployment of the 1inch
    Aggregation Protocol, 1inch Limit Order Protocol, and 1inch Fusion Mode on
    zkSync Era.
    <a href="https://zksync.io/">zkSync Era</a> is a Layer-2 protocol that
    allows Ethereum to scale in a trustless and decentralized manner – this
    deployment will allow 1inch users to make ultra cheap transactions with
    Ethereum-level security.
  </p>

  <h3>Motivation</h3>
  <p>
    By deploying the 1inch Network protocols on zkSync Era, users will benefit
    from lower gas fees and faster transaction confirmations. This will make
    the full suite of 1inch Network protocols more accessible for users without
    sacrificing the security of the protocol.
  </p>

  <h3>Specification</h3>
  <p>
    This proposal serves as a signal from the 1inch Network DAO to 1inch Labs.
    Once passed, the 1inch DAO calls for 1inch Labs to deploy the 1inch
    Aggregation Protocol, 1inch Limit Order Protocol, and 1inch Fusion Mode on
    zkSync Era. 1inch Labs shall also maintain the deployment to ensure an
    optimum user experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    The deployment of 1inch Network protocols on zkSync Era will require
    collaboration between the 1inch core contributors and core contributors of
    Matter Labs.
  </p>

  <h3>Rationale</h3>
  <p>
    zkSync Era is the first zero knowledge rollup with generalized EVM
    compatibility live on mainnet. Deploying the 1inch Network protocols on
    zkSync Era will directly benefit both the users of 1inch protocols as well
    as the 1inch Network itself: users will have a less expensive way to make
    transactions with L1 level security, while the 1inch Network will benefit
    from the increased volume and adoption.
  </p>

  <h3>Considerations</h3>
  <p>
    The deployment of 1inch Network protocols on zkSync Era has no governance
    implications.
  </p>
  <p>
    1inch will have no liquidity locked on zkSync Era, there is no security
    risk associated with this deployment.
  </p>
  <p>
    The increased usage should lead to higher treasury revenues for the 1inch
    DAO.

<h2>Simple Summary</h2>
<p>
  1IP-XX introduces an alternative streamlined governance process to be used in
  an emergency, termed “Fast-Track Proposal”. Fast-track proposals will have a
  lifecycle of 72 hours due to the nature of the proposal.
</p>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
  As 1inch DAO further decentralizes, a fast-track process will be necessary to
  address emergencies. These fast-track proposals will enable the DAO to take
  immediate action; instead of relying on the standard governance process.
  <br />
  1IP-XX outlines the domains or situations that permit a fast-track proposal
  and its scope to prevent malicious abuse.
</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>
  There will be emergencies where we will need to perform an urgent vote for the
  sake of the DAO. The existing{" "}
  <a href="https://docs.1inch.io/docs/governance/overview">

  Implementing a fast-track proposal would decrease the time to pass a proposal
  from 8 days to 3 days.
</p>

<p>
  To indicate a fast-track proposal, community members will have to insert
  “[Fast-Track]” into the title of a proposal i.e., “[Fast-Track] 1IP-20: Deploy
  1INCH on BASE”. This is to alert community members about the nature of the
  proposal. This will also introduce a new tag to the 1inch forum, “Fast-Track”
  to keep track of all fast-track proposals.
</p>

<h4>Scope of the fast-track process</h4>
<p>This process can be utilized under the following circumstances.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Deploying 1INCH on new networks</li>
  <li>
    Changes to the Governance Process i.e. Adding abstain, raising or decreasing
    quorum, adding a new gov process.
  </li>
  <li>Changes surrounding the 1inch resolver</li>
</ol>

<h4>Whitelisted addresses</h4>
<p>
  Due to the low governance participation in 1inch DAO, introducing a fast-track
  process can open the DAO to certain vulnerabilities. Malicious actors can take
  advantage of the fast-track process, so we recommend forming a public list of
  whitelisted addresses that are allowed to propose fast-track proposals.
  <br />
  These addresses/individuals will be on the forums.
  <br />
  We believe that the following community members should be on the initial
  whitelist:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>RoundElephant:0x824732D3F4Eb94a20254cca9DE10485Ce445Bb40</li>
  <li>Natalia: 0x94B85505Dd701f522cDA4F1e7Ea4bA855eef24bf</li>
  <li>StableLab: 0xea172676E4105e92Cc52DBf45fD93b274eC96676</li>
  <li>
    DAOplomats:{" "}
    <a href="https://gov.1inch.io/discussion/Dmat-defi.pod.xyz">
      Dmat-defi.pod.xyz
    </a>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Due to its swift nature, these votes could go unnoticed; therefore, we must
  have a fast-track whitelist in place to prevent damaging behavior.
</p>
<h4>How to add whitelisted addresses:</h4>
<p>
  For a new address to be whitelisted, an already whitelisted address must
  nominate the new addresses. This nomination would be done in a forum post, and
  subsequently, go through the 1inch DAO Governance Process, and finally go to a
  governance vote to determine if the address or addresses should be
  whitelisted.
</p>
<h4>SnapShot Subspace</h4>
<p>
  To facilitate the fast-track process, 1inch DAO will need to set up a separate
  snapshot subspace. This is necessary because this snapshot currently does not
  allow for different lengths for different proposals. <br />
  The newly created snapshot subspace would have a shorter voting period of 2 days.
</p>
<h4>Implementation</h4>
<p>This is how the fast-track proposal would look in practice:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Whitelisted member post a fast-track proposal on the 1inch forum with
    “[Fast-Track]” in the title
  </li>
  <li>
    Any non-whitelisted members who post a fast-track proposal to Snapshot, will
    have their proposals taken down.
  </li>
  <li>After 24 hours, it will move forward to SnapShot.</li>
  <li>1inch token holders will now vote on a proposal via SnapShot.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>
  Every DAO needs a fast-track proposal process to cater to processes which
  require timely intervention; 1inch’s Governance process would require a large
  amount of time from discussion to voting duration to cater to an emergency. As
  the 1inch protocol decentralizes, the community needs this fast-track process
  to address time-sensitive emergencies.

    Increase Number of Whilisted Resolvers
  </a>
</p>

<hr />

<h1>Simple Summary</h1>
<p>
  This proposal seeks to increase the number of whitelisted resolvers in 1inch
  Fusion mode from five (5) to ten (10).
</p>

<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>
  If passed, this proposal will expand the 1inch Fusion mode resolver whitelist
  to ten (currently five). All ten resolvers will be able to participate in
  every stage of the Dutch auction.
</p>

<h1>Motivation</h1>
<p>
  Currently, only the top five resolvers, ranked according to their Unicorn
  Power, are able to fill orders during the first four minutes of the Dutch
  auction. This proposal will increase this number of whitelisted resolvers from
  five to ten — this will improve competition.
</p>

<h1>Specification</h1>
<p>
  This proposal serves as a signal from the 1inch Network DAO to 1inch Labs.
  Once passed, the 1inch Network DAO calls for 1inch Labs to increase the number
  of whitelisted Fusion mode resolvers from five (5) to ten (10).
</p>

<h1>Rationale</h1>
<p>
  <strong>User benefits:</strong> This proposal aims to increase the resolver
  competition, offering users better rates.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Resolver benefits:</strong> This proposal aims to make becoming a
  Fusion mode resolver more attractive, as it reduces the individual capital
  requirements.
</p>

<h1>Considerations</h1>
<p>
  1inch Fusion mode has already been audited and deployed. This proposal will
  have no negative security implications as it will only change the amount of
  participants in the first four minutes of the Dutch auction.

**Full Proposal Description**

</summary>

<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>
  We propose to build a dedicated analytics dashboard for the 1inch ecosystem,
  allowing users to analyze the protocol's main KPIs, activity, treasury, and
  token related metrics. This proposal is coming along after several meetings
  with 1inch core team. We determined the requirements scope and technical
  design together.
</p>

<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>
  The dashboard will allow anyone in the community to browse the protocol's
  treasury, KPIs, token metrics, and transactions. The dashboard will initially
  support the following chains:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ethereum</li>
  <li>Polygon</li>
  <li>Avalanche</li>
  <li>Arbitrum</li>
  <li>Optimism</li>
  <li>BSC Dashboard will be served on a dedicated web app.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Motivation</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    Make the protocol's key information as accessible and transparent as
    possible.
  </li>
  <li>Help governance and users with decision-making.</li>
  <li>
    Provide more thorough information than currently available on Dune (i.e
    breakdown per user, search tooling)
  </li>
</ul>

<h1>Specification</h1>
<p>
  This dashboard will be built using the Dune API as a data source. Data from
  Dune will then be indexed on an intermediate database for easy and quick
  access. We propose to create the following subsections for the dashboard:
</p>

<h3>Homepage (Protocol KPIs)</h3>
<p>
  The UI would be somewhat similar to this:{" "}
  <a href="https://info.notional.finance/">https://info.notional.finance/</a>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Users</li>
  <li>DAU, WAU, MAU</li>
  <li>Cumulative user count</li>
  <li>Transactions</li>
  <li>Daily, weekly and month trade count</li>
  <li>Breakdown of the number of trades per DEX</li>
  <li>Volume</li>
  <li>Daily volume, weekly volume, monthly volume</li>
  <li>Average trade size (daily, weekly, monthly)</li>
  <li>Median trade size (daily, weekly, monthly)</li>
  <li>Volume by underlying liquidity source</li>
</ul>

<h3>1inch Fusion</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1inch Fusion KPIs</li>
  <li>Total orders, volume, unique users (current + historical)</li>
  <li>Latest and top transactions</li>
  <li>Explore and compare resolvers</li>
  <li>Search by address</li>
  <li>
    Compare and access all resolvers in a leaderboard view - Sort by unicorn
    power, staked 1Inch, all-time fees, total orders, …
  </li>
  <li>
    Breakdown per resolver (Total orders and volume, Historical orders and
    volume, Historical fees, Staked 1inch / unicorn power / lockout period)
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Treasury</h3>
<p>
  The UI would be somewhat similar to this:{" "}
  <a href="https://info.notional.finance/treasury">
    https://info.notional.finance/treasury
  </a>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Protocol treasury balances per token.</li>
  <li>Cumulative treasury revenue over time (per token type)</li>
  <li>List of recent treasury transactions</li>
  <li>Protocol revenues (daily/weekly/monthly)</li>
  <li>Revenue as a percentage of volume (daily/weekly/monthly)</li>
</ul>

<h3>1INCH/st1INCH token section</h3>
<p>
  The UI would be somewhat similar to this:{" "}
  <a href="https://info.notional.finance/note-token">
    https://info.notional.finance/note-token
  </a>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Token price over time</li>
  <li>Token unlock supply schedule over time</li>
  <li>TVL</li>
  <li>Amount of staked 1INCH (st1INCH) over time</li>
  <li>Staking rewards</li>
</ul>

<h3>Recent Transactions</h3>
<p>
  The UI would be somewhat similar to this:{" "}
  <a href="https://info.notional.finance/transactions">
    https://info.notional.finance/transactions
  </a>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    List of recent transactions (tx amount, user, main liquidity source, link to
    etherscan)
  </li>
  <li>Filter for a given account</li>
</ul>

<h3>Transaction gas cost estimate</h3>
<p>
  Similar to what we show on the left side of the screen here:{" "}
  <a href="https://info.notional.finance/">https://info.notional.finance/</a>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Estimated gas cost in USD</li>
  <li>Gas price in GWEI chart</li>
  <li>
    ETH price Hosting and maintenance of the web app will be provided by the
    Shippooor team.
  </li>
</ul>

<h1>Rationale</h1>
<p>
  Dune analytics is the current solution for surfacing most of that information.
  Due to technical limitations, Dune does not allow surfacing per-user
  information and does not provide useful search features. Also, in general,
  Dune dashboards have a hard time getting the reach they deserve. Not only the
  information is often non-trivial to understand, but the dashboards themselves
  are hard to find. 1 Inch Dune account:{" "}
  <a href="https://dune.com/1inch">https://dune.com/1inch</a> Important Dune
  Dashboards:{" "}
  <a href="https://dune.com/1inch/main">https://dune.com/1inch/main</a>{" "}
  <a href="https://dune.com/1inch/fusion">https://dune.com/1inch/fusion</a>
</p>

<h1>Considerations</h1>
<h3>Hosting and Maintenance</h3>
<p>
  Website will be hosted through 1inch subdomain (i.e info.1inch.io) Shippooor
  commits to 1 year maintenance. Will be renewed through governance afterward.
  Code will be open sourced.
</p>

<h3>Costs</h3>
<p>Dune API integration work & intermediary database - $35k</p>
<ul>
    <li>Identify and expose all existing Dune queries that will provide data (historical volume, DAU, transactions, protoco, 1inch token)</li>
    <li>Write new Dune queries for missing data (i.e breakdown per resolver, treasury balances/historical data)</li>
    <li>Implement cron workers that will sync all Dune queries with DB through Dune API</li>
    <li>Convert Dune data structures to fit DB's model</li>
    <li>Design and implement a relational model that will allow to quickly query and filter the data (wallets, transactions, 1inch fusion resolvers, treasury portfolios, historical data, etc.)</li>
<li>Design and implement a production setup on AWS (or other cloud provider if needed) supporting all of the above + CI/CD. Likely going to be Amplify + Postgres on RDS</li>
<li>Setup logging and alert to help with monitoring</li>

</ul>
<p>Front-end work - $25k</p>
<ul>
    <li>Build an API that will serve all of the aforementioned indexed data and will allow filtering/sorting (likely going to be a GQL API with similar structure as subgraphs).</li>
    <li>Build a NextJS app that will serve all of the views mentioned in specs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Design - $15k</p>
<ul>
    <li>Visual design and implementation work for page layouts, charts, tables, filtering, sorting, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Maintenance: $10k for year 1</p>
<ul>
    <li>Regular infra monitoring and any bug fixing that may occur</li>
    <li>Minor specification changes</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Total: $85k</strong></p>
<h3>Payment structure</h3>
<p>We propose to receive $25K upfront and the rest of the grant upon delivery of the dashboard. This way the 1Inch grant program takes minimal financial risk and our compensation is based on the delivery of the dashboard. We are also willing to break down the grant in multiple smaller milestones if necessary. Receiving address: 0x70cd17186aae48729f12dba63ba5a9abe7b4116d</p>
<h3>Timeline</h3>
<p>We expect to be able to deliver the dashboard within 8-12 weeks from the grant approval date.</p>
<h3>Team</h3>
<p>Our team has extensive experience in crypto, finance, and software engineering. As builders, we've completed several projects for notable projects including:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.warden.finance/">Warden - Risk & analytics platform for DeFi</a></li>

  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Summary</strong>
</p>
<p>
  This proposal calls for 1inch DAO to donate $100,000 USD towards humanitarian
  relief efforts in response to the{" "}
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Turkey%E2%80%93Syria_earthquake">
    devastating earthquakes that struck Turkiye (Turkey) on February 6th, 2023
  </a>
  .
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Abstract</strong>
</p>
<p>
  This 1IP proposes a donation of $100,000 from the 1inch DAO treasury towards
  humanitarian relief efforts responding to the devastating earthquakes that
  occurred on 6 February 2023 in southern and central Turkey. This donation is
  intended to help save the lives of the victims who are facing severe shortages
  of food, shelter, medical supplies, clean water access, electricity supply
  disruption etc., due to extensive damage caused by these earthquakes.
</p>
<p>
  The donation will be split equally between Anka and BanklessDAO Turkey
  Disaster Relief Fund -- both projects have been vetted by the Ethereum
  community and the author.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Motivation</strong>
</p>
<p>
  This proposal seeks to express solidarity with those affected by this tragedy
  while also providing tangible support for ongoing relief efforts being carried
  out by non-profit organizations.
</p>
<p>
  By donating funds directly to these non-profits we can ensure our contribution
  will be used effectively where it matters most -- supporting people impacted
  across Turkiye.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>BanklessDAO Turkey Disaster Relief Fund</strong> is focused on
  humanitarian relief for those impacted by the earthquakes. They are thoroughly
  vetting several NGOs to distribute funds to.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Anka</strong> is a crypto relief fund that was created to support the
  people of Turkiye after the disastrous earthquakes that hit the region. They
  have over 50 volunteers working on the project including a team located in
  Turkiye. Anka is committed to transparency and accountability.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Specification</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Send $100,000 of{" "}

        </a>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>Rationale</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Given current estimates of over 20,000 fatalities, over 70,000 severe
  injuries, and several million displaced — there is an urgent need for
  immediate assistance. The faster we act, the more lives we potentially save.
</p>
<p>
  The donation must be made on-chain so that the funds can trustlessly be spent
  via a DAO vote.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Considerations</strong>
</p>
<p>
  From a security standpoint, there are no major implications associated with
  this proposal other than verifying that the Safesnap transaction data is
  correct.
</p>
<p>
  Though Syria was also affected by the earthquake, it is currently under
  international sanctions and has been omitted from this proposal. All funds
  will go to humanitarian efforts Turkiye.

    </a>
  </p>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    To boost governance activity on 1inch, we would like to incentivize
    community members to present proposals and receive rewards.
  </p>
  <h2>Motivation</h2>
  <p>
    An active governance culture is an essential aspect of every DAO’s
    operations. Active governance means that the community is dedicated to
    improving the protocol’s operations, which builds a culture of iteration
    around the protocol. However, governance work is continuously under or
    unpaid, making it an unattractive role.
  </p>
  <p>
    By incentivizing an active governance culture at 1inch, we can attract
    participants to become more involved in 1inch DAO, thus enabling more
    opportunities for 1INCH to decentralize. 1INCH DAO tried a similar program
    last year using
    <a href="https://beta.layer3.xyz/" target="_blank">
      {" "}
      Layer 3
    </a>, which was successful in attracting participants.

  <h3>Aims</h3>
  <p>
    1INCH governance is still somewhat inactive, and in these current market
    conditions, it is even harder to attract governance participation. We hope
    some form of incentive will attract users to engage with the 1inch DAO.
  </p>
  <p>
    We would like to present this program for 6 months at a total cost of 6,000
    USDC.
  </p>
  <h3>Allocation</h3>
  <p>
    This proposal would allocate 6,000 USDC to a newly-made community multi-sig.
    Each successful proposal would receive 500 USDC.&nbsp; At the end of each
    month, the community multi-sig will distribute rewards to the eligible
    authors. This is to reduce the unnecessary cost to the DAO.
  </p>
  <p>This would incentivize a total of 12 proposals across 6 months.</p>
  <p>
    Since 1INCH earns protocol revenue in USDC, it is easier to distribute
    governance rewards in USDC. If all USDC is distributed, this would cost the
    DAO 6,000 USDC for 6 months.

**Full Proposal Description**

</summary>

<div class="sc-aVUuG fVABEa"><p>Author:&nbsp;DAOplomats.eth</p>

#Simple Summary

This proposal aims to add an “Abstain” option in the 1inch DAO governance process, allowing members to abstain from voting.

#Abstract

This proposal aims to add Adding the abstain option, in addition to “Yes” and “No”, allowing voters and delegates to participate in voting without having to take a side.

Motivation

The current governance process of the 1inch DAO only allows members to vote Yes or No on proposals. This system can be limiting as it does not allow members to express their opinions accurately, particularly if they are unsure of the consequences of a proposal or do not have enough information to make a decision. Adding an Abstain option to the voting process will allow members to express their views more accurately and increase the overall transparency of the governance process.

Specification

Under the current governance process, the voting options are limited to ‘Yes’ or ‘No’

If this proposal is successfully implemented, the following changes will be reflected.

image

Proposed Changes

|| During this period, addresses with voting power may vote for, against or abstain from voting on the proposal using the same three voting options as the Phase-3 poll:

(Yes) In favour of this proposal.

(No) Against this proposal.||

(Abstain) Neither In favour nor Against

The Abstain Button is expected to be used in the following cases

Neutrality: The Abstain option allows members to remain neutral on a proposal and not take a stance, which can be useful when members are unsure of the proposal's consequences or do not have enough information to decide
Higher Conflict of interest: As part of proposal hygiene, Authors of the proposals tend to abstain from voting on their proposals even though they act in the best interest of the DAO. Furthermore, Voters tend to abstain from voting if there is a high conflict of interests as a voter and the proposed implications.
Insufficient information: In case a proposal is moved to snapshot with insufficient information or data, a voter can choose to abstain, thus signalling their unwillingness to decide without further information or discussion
The proposed changes will impact any existing quorums or the requirement to pass a proposal.

Rationale

This proposal aims to encourage members to participate in the voting process, which may have otherwise not participated due to a lack of clear stance on a proposal.

Considerations

There are no security implications with this proposal.

Once passed, the 1IPs should include ‘Abstain’ as a voting option

The Governance Doc of 1inch DAO should be updated through a GitHub pull request to update the changes

  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>
    If passed, this proposal will allow st1INCH(v2) holders to participate in
    1inch DAO Snapshot votes.
  </p>
  <p>Legacy st1INCH and v1INCH will have unchanged voting weights.</p>

    , and the subsequent launch of 1inch Fusion mode, st1INCH(v2) has become the
    primary utility token of 1inch Network. In recent weeks, st1INCH(v2) has overtaken
    legacy st1INCH in terms of supply.
  </p>
  <p>
    This proposal will enfranchise st1INCH(v2) holders and should increase the
    number of active participants in the 1inch DAO.
  </p>
  <h2>Specification</h2>
  <p>
    The{" "}
    <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/1inch.eth" target="_blank">
      1inch Network Snapshot space
    </a>{" "}
    will be updated to account for st1INCH(v2) voting power. Meaning, st1INCH
    (v2) will be added as a new “strategy” with equal voting weight to legacy
    st1INCH. Holders would then be able to use their respective voting weights
    when participating in votes on proposals.

  <h2>Rationale</h2>
  <p>
    V2 stakers have demonstrated commitment to the 1inch Network and deserve an

    voters, we can better reflect community sentiment while ensuring that those
    with vested interests remain incentivized towards long-term success of the
    network.
  </p>
  <p>
    Legacy st1INCH will retain its voting power for the time being. It is
    expected that the DAO will vote to deprecate legacy st1INCH voting rights in
    the coming months as more of the stake migrates to the new contracts.

      1inch governance process
    </a>
  </p>
  <h2>Simple Summary</h2>
  <p>
    1IP-13 “Governance Process Improvements” introduces changes to the current
    governance process to create a more agile yet robust process.
  </p>
  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>
    It takes around 12 days to implement a change via governance. This is
    time-consuming, especially since there is no express pathway to execute
    proposals in time-sensitive situations.
  </p>
  <p>
    1IP-13 will reduce the current governance timeline in different ways to
    ensure that governance changes can be enacted swiftly without compromising
    security.
  </p>
  <h2>Motivation</h2>
  <p>
    The current 1inch governance framework is far too long, which can hinder the
    DAOs ability to execute quickly.
  </p>
  <h2>Specification</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Current Process</li>
    <li>Amendments</li>
    <li>New Process</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Current Process</p>
  <p>
    The current process can be found&nbsp;
    <a
      href="https://gov.1inch.io/t/1inch-dao-governance-process/1973"
      target="_blank"
    >
      here
    </a>, but here is a summary.
  </p>
  <p>
    Phase 1 (Discussion) &amp; Phase 2 (1IP formalization) have an open-ended
    duration, so they have no specific deadline.
  </p>
  <p>
    Phase 3 (temperature check) lasts five days. Proposals stay unchanged in
    this phase.
  </p>
  <p>Phase 4 (Snapshot Vote) lasts seven days.</p>
  <p>
    Phase 5 (Implementation) lasts a minimum of six days - This can be ignored
    since it does not involve the community.
  </p>
  <p>
    This means that the current governance process (ignoring phase 5) totals a
    minimum of 12 days to pass a proposal.
  </p>
  <p>Amendments</p>
  <p>We recommend the following amendments:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Phase 3 - &nbsp;Reduce from five days to three days.</li>
    <li>Phase 4 &nbsp;- Reduce from seven days to five days</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These changes ensure enough time to cast a forum and snapshot vote without
    compromising security. Across other DAOs, having a Snapshot vote last around
    five days is common practice. It provides a grey area between 3 days (too
    short) and 7 days (too long).
  </p>
  <p>New Process</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Phase 1 &amp; Phase 2 &nbsp;- Open-ended</li>
    <li>Phase 3 - &nbsp;Lasts three days</li>
    <li>Phase 4 &nbsp;- Lasts five days</li>
    <li>Phase 5 - Lasts seven days</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This new governance process (ignoring phase 5) totals a minimum of 8 days to
    pass a proposal instead of the original 12 days.
  </p>
  <h2>Rationale</h2>
  <p>
    The lengthy process has hindered the DAOs’ ability to execute promptly in
    the past. This reduction will still ensure a suitable amount of time for DAO
    members to participate in the DAO without sacrificing security.
  </p>
  <p>Considerations</p>
  <p>
    This will make it easier for the DAO to pass proposals that could open a
    security risk to malicious actors.
  </p>
  <h2>Next Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Discuss the Proposal</li>
    <li>Forum temperature check</li>
    <li>
      Move it to a vote
      <ol>
        <li>[Yes]: Implement these governance changes</li>

      <h2>Simple Summary</h2>
      <p>
        This proposal seeks to modify 1inch Fusion to allow all five of the top
        resolvers to fill orders during the entire duration of the Dutch
        Auction.
      </p>
      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        If passed, this proposal will change the way that 1inch Fusion orders
        are filled by allowing all five resolvers to participate in every stage
        of the Dutch auction. This change will increase competition amongst
        resolvers and ensure that users are getting the best rates.
      </p>
      <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        Currently, the top five resolvers are given fill priority according to
        their Unicorn Power. For the first minute of the Dutch auction, only the
        resolver with the highest Unicorn Power can fill the order. Then, the
        resolver with the second most Unicorn Power joins them for the second
        minute, and so forth… This proposal will foster a more competitive
        auction by giving all resolvers equal priority.
      </p>
      <p>
        This proposal aims to increase competition amongst resolvers and thus
        provide better rates for users when they make swaps via the 1inch
        Network.
      </p>
      <h2>Specification</h2>
      <p>
        This proposal serves as a signal from the 1inch Network DAO to 1inch
        Labs. Once passed, the 1inch Network DAO calls for 1inch Labs to modify
        the Fusion logic to allow all five resolvers to participate in every
        stage of the Dutch auction.
      </p>
    
      <p>Above is the existing Fusion auction order structure.</p>
      <p>
        Below is the modified Fusion auction order structure that this proposal
        calls for.
      </p>
      <h2>Rationale</h2>
      <p>
        Allowing for pure competition amongst the five resolvers, rather than
        giving preferential access based on staking power, will facilitate
        better swap rates and faster execution times.
      </p>
      <p>
        This change will also make it more attractive for professional market
        makers to become resolvers, which may lead to a greater demand for 1INCH
        token as they accumulate the necessary Unicorn Power.
      </p>
      <h2>Considerations</h2>
      <p>
        1inch Fusion mode has already been audited and deployed. This proposal
        will have no negative security implications as it will only change the
        structure of the Dutch auction.
      </p>
      <p>
        An increase in the number of resolvers participating in the Fusion
        auctions should reduce the likelihood of resolver collusion.

<a href="https://github.com/1inch/delegating" target="_blank">GitHub - 1inch/delegating 1</a></p>
<h2>Simple Summary</h2>
<p>This proposal seeks to implement a new Staking Pod mechanic for the 1INCH token. This system will consist of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Incentivised time-locked 1INCH staking</li>
<li>Permissionless delegation pods</li>
<li>Reward distribution compatibility</li>
<li>50% of all current, and future, 1inch DAO protocol revenue shall be distributed to stakers</li>
</ul>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>With the Staking Pod system, users lock their 1INCH tokens in a staking contract to get st1INCH tokens — the longer the lock period, the more st1INCH tokens the user gets. st1INCH tokens can be used by stakers for 1inch DAO governance, and the 1inch DAO can choose to use these token balances for reward distribution. The system is modular as anyone can launch a new Modular Delegation Pod and can use the reward functionality to incentivize certain actions and/or assign utility to the 1INCH token. 50% of all current, and future, 1inch DAO revenue shall be distributed to stakers.</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>1INCH token is the governance token of the 1inch Network. It provides voting rights within the 1inch DAO’s governance system, and users can stake it to receive a <a href="https://blog.1inch.io/the-extended-gas-refund-program-is-now-available-to-yet-more-users-1d48de21aae3" target="_blank">refund 3</a> on their transaction fees. However, despite these functions, the amount of 1INCH tokens currently being held in <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0xa0446d8804611944f1b527ecd37d7dcbe442caba" target="_blank">staking contracts is quite low</a> and governance participation is even lower. We believe that this is due to a lack of incentives to participate in governance and a lack of additional utility for staked 1INCH.</p>
<p>By introducing Modular Staking Pods, we hope to give stakers more direct control over how their stake is used to power the 1inch Network. This change will allow them to independently select how their stake governs each of the protocols and will allow for rewards to permissionlessly be distributed based on the actions of the stakers. We envision that this will improve the goverance by aligning incentives between people who want to stake to earn rewards and those who are interested in protocol governance – both players will have direct incentives to participate in the same system.</p>
<p>We believe that this proposal represents a step forward for the 1inch Network and that it will help increase adoption and usage of the network’s future protocols.</p>
<h2>Specification</h2>

<h3>Staking</h3>
<p>
  Like the existing 1INCH staking contract, users will be able to lock their
  1INCH tokens in the staking contract to get st1INCH tokens that can be used
  for 1inch DAO governance. However, unlike the current system, Modular Staking
  will require users to lock their 1INCH for a set amount of time.
</p>
<h3>Locking</h3>
<p>
  The minimum and maximum lock periods are chosen by the DAO through — for the
  purposes of analysis, we’ll use 1 month and 2 years as the minimum and maximum
  staking periods respectively. st1INCH tokens grant users “voting power” which
  they can use for various use cases. The longer the locking period the more
  “voting power” resolver can get. However, the increase in power is not linear.
</p>

<p>There will be a minimum locking period of 1 month.</p>
<p>
  Note that st1INCH voting power will decay over time according to the locking
  curve. Also note that users can re-lock their stake at any time to refresh
  their st1INCH balance. Users will be able to withdraw their stake early but
  will forfeit a portion of their rewards.
</p>

<p>Orange is the amount lost when a staker withdraws earlier than they originally committed.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In 2023, Sally stakes 100 1INCH and selects a 2-year lock period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They receive 100 st1INCH from the staking contract and this balance decays over time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By 2024 Sally’s st1INCH balance has decayed to 22.36</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sally then chooses to re-lock her stake for the maximum amount of time, 2-years, and her st1INCH balance is increased to 100.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sally chose not to re-lock, and in 2026, after the lock period, she withdraws her original 100 1INCH.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Unlocking</h3>
<p>If a st1INCH staker wishes to unlock they will forfeit some of their tokens based on the following equation:</p>
<p>withdrawalAmount = (balance - votingPower) / 0.9</p>
<p>penalty = balance - withdrawalAmount</p>
<p>In this setting, the maximum early withdrawal loss is 90% as the minimum locking period is 1 month</p>
<h3>Admin Control</h3>
<p>The 1inch DAO Treasury Address, <a href="https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0x7951c7ef839e26F63DA87a42C9a87986507f1c07/balances" target="_blank">0x7951c7ef839e26F63DA87a42C9a87986507f1c07</a>, would act as admin of the staking contract with control over the following functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>setFeeReceiver – this would allow the DAO to change the vault to collect the rewards for later distribution between stakers and the DAO treasury.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>setDefaultFarm – this would allow the DAO to change the default reward distribution contract for 1INCH staking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>setMaxLossRatio – this would allow the DAO to change the earliest point at which people can early withdraw their stake by disallowing withdrawals with larger withdrawal fees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>setEmergencyExit – This is basically an abort function and would allow the DAO to end the staking scheme. All stakers can reclaim the entire amount of their original stake regardless of their remaining locking period. This would be used if the DAO wanted to migrate to a new staking contract to change key variables, like the maximum lock period.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Modular Delegation</h3>
<p>The Modular Delegation system provides users with a set of delegation contracts that are specific to a topic. The set of delegation contracts is permissionless, meaning that anyone can deploy one and allow users to delegate their st1INCH within it.</p>
<p>The 1inch DAO will have the power to endorse a delegation contract and feature it in the 1inch staking UI.</p>
<p>For the start, we propose just two delegation topics:</p>
<p><strong>Snapshot governance delegation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This will allow users to delegate their Snapshot voting power to a recognized delegate from the UI, or manually enter an Ethereum/ENS address.</li>
<li>Nested within this is the vanilla<a href="https://docs.snapshot.org/guides/delegation" target="_blank"> Snapshot space-specific delegation contract 1</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>st1INCH utility delegation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As part of this staking upgrade, there will be a new protocol added to 1inch’s suite of DeFi tools that will substantially improve the utility of st1INCH.</li>
<li>Service providers that want to tap into the utility of st1INCH can proposition the community for delegated power.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Rewards</h3>
<p>Modular Staking will have two levels of reward functionality: Generic st1INCH rewards and Modular Delegation rewards.</p>
<h4>Generic st1INCH rewards</h4>
<p>The st1INCH contract will allow anyone to run a farm to distribute rewards to everyone holding st1INCH tokens.</p>
<p>Users also have the ability to to join as many farms as they want as it does not required a user to move their st1inch to a specific farm. Along as a user holds st1inch in their account, they can receive rewards from multiple farms.</p>
<p>This proposal calls for 50% of all current, and future, 1inch DAO revenue to be distributed to stakers in the form of 1INCH.</p>
<h4>Modular Delegation rewards</h4>
<p>Some Modular Delegation contracts have&nbsp; an integrated rewards function that anyone can run a farm atop.</p>
<p>The main advantage to this type of reward is that it is not limited to being proportional to a user’s st1INCH holdings. Any action, onchain or offchain, can be used as the basis of reward distribution. This functionality could be used by the 1inch DAO to incentivize anything from editing 1IPs to using a new 1inch protocol (and everything in between).</p>
<p>Example: The 1inch DAO may use the Snapshot governance delegation contract to incentivize active governance participation by boosting the st1INCH rewards of people who vote on proposals, delegate their st1INCH to active voters, etc…</p>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>The rationale for this proposal is to provide a more flexible staking system that can be used to incentivize various activities within the 1inch Network. The new Modular Delegation contracts will allow for rewards to be distributed based on anything from voting on proposals to using new 1inch protocols. This will provide a greater incentive for users to participate in the network and help drive adoption of new 1inch products and services.</p>
<h2>Considerations</h2>
<p>The security considerations for this proposal are mainly around the potential for abuse of the new staking and delegation contracts. It is important to ensure that there are adequate safeguards in place to prevent users from delegating their voting power to malicious actors.</p>
<p>The governance considerations for this proposal include the impact on revenue streams and changes to the governance processes. This proposal could potentially increase revenue for the 1inch DAO if it is successful in incentivizing more users to participate in the network. It is also worth considering how these changes will impact existing voting processes within the 1inch DAO since the existing staking contract will be deprecated.</p>

<div>
  <div class="sc-gFCZzz gYcqAq">
    <h2>Simple Summary</h2>
    <p>
      This proposal seeks to modify the 1inch Network DAO Treasury’s revenue
      collection strategy by enacting the following changes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Switch from buying USDC with Swap Surplus revenue to buying 1INCH when
        the price is lower than $1.30.
      </li>
      <li>
        Switch from buying 1INCH with Swap Surplus revenue to buying USDC the
        price of 1INCH is greater than or equal to $1.70.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      Currently, the Swap Surplus{" "}

        USDC
      </a>{" "}
      before it is then sent to the 1inch DAO{" "}
      <a
        href="https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0x7951c7ef839e26F63DA87a42C9a87986507f1c07/transactions/history"
        target="_blank"
      >
        Treasury
      </a>
      . Once enacted, this proposal will instead swap these tokens to <a
        href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x111111111117dc0aa78b770fa6a738034120c302"
        target="_blank"
      >
        1INCH
      </a> as long as the market price of 1INCH is below the $1.30 to $1.70 range
      (see the Specification section for a detailed explanation). All swaps will
      be done using the <a
        href="https://docs.1inch.io/docs/aggregation-protocol/introduction"
        target="_blank"
      >
        1inch Aggregation Protocol
      </a> to ensure the best pricing.
    </p>
    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>Benefits to the 1inch Network DAO include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Investing the DAO’s revenue stream into the protocol’s governance token
        while the governance token is lower than it was previously valued.
      </li>
      <li>
        Potential upward pressure on the 1INCH token as the DAO Treasury will be
        a net buyer of cheap 1INCH.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the token is trading at higher valuations, the Treasury will
        automatically de-risk by collecting revenue in stable coins.
      </li>
      <li>
        Holding 1INCH within the 1inch DAO Treasury will allow the Treasury to
        scale its value with the performance of the token.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Specification</h2>
    <p>
      This proposal serves as a signal from the 1inch Network DAO to 1inch Labs.
      Once passed, the 1inch Network DAO calls for 1inch Labs to modify the fee
      collection strategy with the following changes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        When the price of 1INCH moves is below $1.30, Swap Surplus revenue shall
        start to be collected in 1INCH.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the price of 1INCH moves above $1.70, Swap Surplus revenue shall be
        collected in USDC.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Once the modifications have been made and tested, 1inch Labs shall deploy
      them. All future modifications to these will need to be done by a 1inch
      DAO Governance vote.
    </p>
    <h2>Rationale</h2>
    <p>
      This proposal aims to purchase 1INCH with treasury revenue when the price
      is lower than ~$1.50. $0.20 bands are used on either side of this buying
      point in order to dampen the impact that market volatility could have.
    </p>
    <p>
      This price point of 1INCH that triggers the switch can be changed in the
      future via a governance vote.
    </p>
    <h2>Considerations</h2>
    <h3>Market Risk</h3>
    <p>
      The USDC stablecoin composition of the 1inch DAO Treasury puts the
      Treasury in a very good position during any bearish market cycles — the
      Treasury constantly grows in dollar value while, in contrast, projects
      that primarily hold their own token, have had the real value of their
      Treasury shrink in the last 6 months.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adding 1INCH to the Treasury composition will increase both the potential
      risk and potential returns. This proposal dampens the volatility by
      maintaining a mix of risk-on and risk-off assets.
    </p>
    <h3>Added Complexity</h3>
    <p>
      If enacted, this proposal will add complexity to the Treasury Revenue
      collection strategy.

  <div class="sc-gFCZzz gYcqAq">
    <h2>Simple Summary</h2>
    <p>
      This proposal seeks to diversify the 1inch Network DAO’s Treasury
      composition be enacting the following strategy:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Do not exchange a whitelisted set of tokens for USDC before sending to
        the 1inch DAO Treasury.
      </li>
      <li>
        These whitelisted tokens shall be: ETH, WETH, WBTC, DAI, and USDT.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      Currently, all of the Swap Surplus revenue stream is collected in varying
      tokens and swapped to USDC before being sent to the 1inch DAO Treasury. To
      start the diversification process of the treasury funds, the protocol can
      keep some incoming Swap Surplus tokens as collected (not swapping them for
      USDC).
    </p>
    <p>
      This proposal aims to whitelist the following tokens for this treasury
      collection strategy:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>ETH</li>
      <li>WETH</li>
      <li>WBTC</li>
      <li>DAI</li>
      <li>USDT</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>
      The 1inch DAO Treasury is 100% composed of USDC. USDC is a fiat-backed
      stablecoin pegged to USD managed by Circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      USD experienced record inflation over the last 12 months, and will
      experience some degree of inflation for perpetuity. As such, the marginal
      spending power of the 1inch DAO Treasury is weakened unless the DAO
      deploys the funds in a manner that can outpace inflation.
    </p>
    <p>
      These assets are viewed as risk-on diversification assets for the
      treasury:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>ETH – the native asset of the Ethereum blockchain</li>
      <li>WETH – ETH wrapped in an ERC20 wrapper</li>
      <li>
        WBTC – Bitcoin (BTC) is the oldest and largest digital asset. WBTC is
        Bitcoin wrapped in an ERC20 wrapper
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Stablecoins also have inherent risks such as smart contract risks and
      centralization risks. Diversifying the stable coin holdings of the 1inch
      DAO Treasury aims to hedge against these risks. These assets are viewed as
      risk-off assets for the treasury:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        DAI – the decentralized collateral-backed stablecoin issued by the Maker
        Protocol. DAI is soft-pegged to USD
      </li>
      <li>
        USDT – the fiat-backed stablecoin pegged to USD and managed by Tether
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Specification</h2>
    <p>
      To implement this proposal, GovernanceLeftoverExchanger should transfer
      ETH, WETH, WBTC, DAI and USDT directly to the treasury the same way it
      transfers USDC. All other tokens should still be converted to USDC as they
      are now.
    </p>
    <h2>Rationale</h2>
    <p>
      The crypto market cap took a decline in recent months. With token
      valuations depressed, it may be a good time to start accumulating
      non-stable tokens to grow the treasury.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since exchange transactions cost some Ether to pay for the gas fees,
      eliminating the swapping step for these whitelisted tokens will increase
      the capital efficiency of this operation. It is also for this reason that
      large stable coins such as DAI and USDT, should be sent directly to the
      treasury.
    </p>
    <h2>Considerations</h2>
    <p>
      The current stablecoin composition of the 1inch DAO Treasury ensures that
      the Treasury is insulated from bearish market cycles. However, this also
      means the treasury’s funds have no way to keep pace with the rise in
      inflation. Adding ETH, WETH and WBTC increase both the risk and the
      potential rewards.
    </p>
    <p>
      This proposal does not call for any actions to be taken with the funds
      currently held by the 1inch DAO Treasury.

      into the 1inch Aggregation Protocol.
    </p>
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      This proposal aims to grow the kinds of liquidity sources compatible with
      the 1inch Aggregation Protocol by integrating Balancer Boosted Pools. To
      fund this development, a BAL grant from Balancer DAO and Balancer DAO will
      be awarded to 1inch Labs upon the successful completion of the
      integration. Specifically, the following
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        1inch Labs shall integrate the Balancer Boosted Pools into the 1inch
        smart contracts, the 1inch dApp, and the 1inch API.
      </li>
      <li>
        The integration shall be live on the Ethereum main-net no later than 3
        weeks after this proposal passes the Phase-4 snapshot vote.
      </li>
      <li>
        If both conditions 1 and 2 are met, Balancer DAO and Balancer DAO will
        transfer 20k BAL or the equivalent in stablecoins (as determined by
        Balancer DAO) to 1inch Labs.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>
      Balancer Boosted Pools are a new pool type that have been gaining traction
      from many DeFi protocols. These pools were previously discussed with the
      1inch community on the{" "}
      <a
        href="https://gov.1inch.io/t/1inch-balancer-boosted-pools/3012"
        target="_blank"

        1inch Governance Forum
      </a>{" "}
      as well as the{" "}
      <a href="https://youtu.be/OQF0wqgQXDg" target="_blank">
        1inch Network DAO Community Call #02
      </a>
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      Given that this is a new pool type and requires effort from 1inch Labs,
      Balancer seeks to fund this integration via a payment of 20,000 BAL to
      1inch Labs.
    </p>
    <h2>Specification</h2>
    <p>
      At a high level, integration of Balancer Boosted Pools would require
      support for Balancer’s BatchSwap function, the routing of trades through
      multiple Balancer pools including linear pools nested in the boosted pool
      and the math in the linear pools. This proposal hopes that the support for
      Boosted Pools is general and can later be expanded to new future Boosted
      Pools. The integration of Balancer’s BatchSwap function within the 1inch
      Network will also be able to be used for pools other than Boosted Pools
      which would benefit both the 1inch Network and Balancer as it would allow
      for cheaper execution of trades from the wider Balancer pool types. In the
      near future we expect to see meta pools created with the BPT of Boosted
      Pools, an example would be a bbaUSD/WETH pool. Routing trades through such
      pools would include one or more extra hop through Balancer’s BatchSwap
      function.
    </p>
    <p>
      We expect that there will be many new Boosted Pools across all networks in
      near future, namely poos in collaboration with Ampleforth and Olympus
      although, below is a non-exhaustive list of currently live Boosted Pools
      on Ethereum L1:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>bbaUSD, containing 300mm of DAI/USDC/USDT TVL</li>
      <li>
        bbfUSD,{" "}
        <a
          href="https://tribe.fei.money/t/fip-90-fuse-boosted-usd-balancer-pool-bb-f-usd/4023"
          target="_blank"
        >
          expected
        </a>{" "}
        to contain at least 50mm of FEI/LUSD/DAI
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      This is contingent on the same proposal passing through the BalancerDAO.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon satisfactory integration{" "}
      <sup>
        <em>Note1</em>
      </sup>
      , 20,000 BAL shall be sent to 1inch Labs ETH address:

    <p>0x2DF104682A61241C79eBB3ce3b2C293578bF6A9D.</p>
    <p>
      <em>Note 1</em>: Satisfactory integration is defined as the 1inch
      Aggregation Protocol accurately forwarding trades through the bbaUSD and
      the bbfUSD pools, on Ethereum main-net, when those pools offer the optimal
      pricing for the end-user.
    </p>
    <h2>Rationale</h2>
    <p>
      Support for the mentioned pools will unlock $350mm of efficient TVL for
      the 1inch Aggregation Protocol and allow it to have access to cheap
      liquidity for trade routing at the moment of integration and much more TVL
      in the future as Boosted Pool continue their adoption. Additionally,
      Boosted Pools have been adapted by BeethovenX, Balancer’s Friendly Fork on
      Fantom and, integrating them would provide a good source for volume to
      1inch on Fantom as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Balancer Boosted Pools are in much demand from other DeFi protocols due to
      their innovation in capital efficiency thus, it is expected to see many
      more Balancer Boosted Pools with high TVL in collaboration with other
      DAOs, some of which were mentioned in the discussion on the forum.
      Supporting Boosted Pools will position the 1inch aggregator to be able to
      rapidly integrate any new Boosted Pools launched.
    </p>
    <p>
      This BAL grant would be used by 1inch Labs to fund the development of this
      integration.
    </p>
    <h2>Considerations</h2>
    <p>
      The technical specifics of this integration will be defined by 1inch Labs.
      Like all new modules they have launched, a complete internal security
      review and audit should be performed before this change is implemented on
      main-net.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because Balancer DAO is directly funding this integration, other upgrades
      to the 1inch Network can be made in parallel.

**Full Proposal Description**

</summary>

<div>
  <h2>Simple Summary</h2>
  <p>
    This proposal seeks to add derivative aggregation to the 1inch Protocol.
    Specifically, it calls for the following additions:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Aggregation Protocol is expanded to include derivatives</li>
    <li>
      Add derivative aggregation to the 1inch smart contracts, 1inch dApp, and
      1inch API
    </li>
    <li>
      The first derivative supported will be Opium’s TURBO products (call
      options)
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>
    This proposal aims to signal to the 1inch Foundation that the DAO wants to
    add derivative aggregation to the 1inch Protocol – specifically, the 1inch
    smart contracts, the 1inch dApp, and the 1inch API. Adding derivative
    aggregation to the protocol will require technical effort from 1inch Labs,
    and will require the support of 1inch Foundation.
  </p>
  <h2>Motivation</h2>
  <p>
    1inch is currently the leading decentralized exchange aggregator and has
    made a reputation of providing the best prices on token swaps. With the rise
    of derivatives in the DeFi space, there is a new product niche that 1inch is
    perfectly positioned to capitalize on:{" "}
    <strong>the aggregation of derivative products.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    By implementing this proposal, 1inch will solve the problem of fractured
    derivative liquidity (just like it previously solved fractured token
    liquidity).
  </p>
  <h2>Specification</h2>
  <p>
    This proposal serves as a signal from the 1inch Network DAO to the 1inch
    Foundation and 1inch Labs. Once passed, the 1inch Network DAO calls for the
    1inch Foundation to allot resources to add derivative aggregation to the
    1inch Protocol and dApp, and for 1inch Labs to add derivative aggregation to
    the 1inch smart contracts and 1inch API.
  </p>
  <p>Opium’s TURBO product is a short-dated call option:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Community / users can “write” covered calls by pooling their tokens in
      order to earn yield (collect call option premiums)
    </li>
    <li>
      Takers (professional market makers) can buy the call options in order to
      gain leveraged exposure to the underlying asset
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Adding Opium’s TURBO options to the aggregation UI will require coordination
    with the Opium community to ensure a smooth integration.
  </p>
  <h2>Rationale</h2>
  <p>The architecture of the aggregation protocol has not yet been defined.</p>
  <p>
    Opium’s TURBO product was chosen as the first derivative supported because
    the Opium community was offering to help with this integration via
    documentation and SDKs.
  </p>
  <h2>Considerations</h2>
  <p>
    The specifics of launching an aggregation protocol will not be defined until
    the 1inch Foundation supports the proposal. Like all new modules they have
    launched, a complete security review and audit should be performed before
    this change is implemented on mainnet.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since all work described in this proposal will be organized by the 1inch
    Foundation, this will not cost any treasury funds.
