**Full Proposal Description**

</summary>

<div><div class="sc-JsfZP kBcPwt"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>1inch Network was founded on core values of decentralization and open financial freedom, with a goal of improving the human condition for everyone on the planet. As one of the leading dApps in the DeFi space, it is in a unique position to extend additional assistance to people in a time of need.</p>
<p>With that said, this proposal seeks to donate 1 million USDC of 1inch DAO Treasury funds to support humanitarian aid within the country of Ukraine.</p>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Since inception just over 3 months ago, the 1inch DAO Treasury has been highly successful in growing its total capital. It has accumulated close to 7 million USDC to date from a steady income stream of swap surplus funds. This proposal aims to donate 1 million USDC of these accumulated funds to provide critical humanitarian support within Ukraine’s conflict zone.</p>
<p>Specifically, these funds will be converted into USDT via 1inch v4 protocol, then transferred to the official wallet of Ukraine, as outlined <a href="https://twitter.com/ukraine/status/1497594592438497282?s=21" target="_blank">here</a>. These funds will then be distributed as needed to civilians for repairing infrastructure, supporting health facilities with medicine and equipment, and supporting families with food and hygiene items.</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>1inch Network is a global project which brings together extraordinary minds from all over the world. Both users and contributors alike are negatively affected by the recent war-time events unfolding this week, and it is the absolute duty of 1inch DAO to provide support to civilians within the conflict zone in every way possible.</p>
<h2>Specification</h2>
<ol>
<li>Swap 1,000,500 USDC to USDT within multi-sig on <a href="https://app.1inch.io/" target="_blank">1inch app</a></li>
<li>Transfer 1,000,000 USDT from 1inch DAO Treasury multi-sig wallet to the official humanitarian wallet of Ukraine</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Due to exchange rates, a slightly higher amount of USDC is required to receive 1,000,000 USDT when swapping</em></p>

<li>
<p>1inch DAO Treasury address: 0x7951c7ef839e26f63da87a42c9a87986507f1c07</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Donation address: 0x165CD37b4C644C2921454429E7F9358d18A45e14</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>This donation address has been <a href="https://twitter.com/TomicahTD/status/1497601610775769094" target="_blank">verified</a> by the crypto community as legitimate, and has been identified as having a direct impact on the humanitarian crisis currently unfolding in Ukraine.</p>
<h2>Considerations</h2>
<p>With the 1inch DAO Treasury’s historical rate of growth, the donation amount of 1 million USDC will have minimal impact on the DAO’s ability to fund future developments of 1inch Network. At the same time, this amount will have a significant impact on the humanitarian relief efforts for Ukraine and its citizens.</p>
<p>For accountability, a screenshot and link to the transaction will be added to this proposal once the transfer of funds is complete.</p>

### [1IP-05] Add Derivative Aggregation to 1inch Network

**Full Proposal Description**


</summary>

<div>
<h2>Simple Summary</h2>
<p>This proposal seeks to add derivative aggregation to the 1inch Protocol. Specifically, it calls for the following additions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aggregation protocol is expanded to include derivatives</li>
<li>Add derivative aggregation to the 1inch smart contracts, 1inch dApp, and 1inch API</li>
<li>The first derivative supported will be Opium’s TURBO products (call options)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This proposal aims to signal to the 1inch Foundation that the DAO wants to add derivative aggregation to the 1inch Protocol – specifically, the 1inch smart contracts, the 1inch dApp, and the 1inch API. Adding derivative aggregation to the protocol will require technical effort from 1inch Labs, and will require the support of 1inch Foundation.</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>1inch is currently the leading decentralized exchange aggregator and has made a reputation of providing the best prices on token swaps. With the rise of derivatives in the DeFi space, there is a new product niche that 1inch is perfectly positioned to capitalize on: <strong>the aggregation of derivative products.</strong></p>
<p>By implementing this proposal, 1inch will solve the problem of fractured derivative liquidity (just like it previously solved fractured token liquidity).</p>
<h2>Specification</h2>
<p>This proposal serves as a signal from the 1inch Network DAO to the 1inch Foundation and 1inch Labs. Once passed, the 1inch Network DAO calls for the 1inch Foundation to allot resources to add derivative aggregation to the 1inch Protocol and dApp, and for 1inch Labs to add derivative aggregation to the 1inch smart contracts and 1inch API.</p>
<p>Opium’s TURBO product is a short-dated call option:</p>
<ul>
<li>Community / users can “write” covered calls by pooling their tokens in order to earn yield (collect call option premiums)</li>
<li>Takers (professional market makers) can buy the call options in order to gain leveraged exposure to the underlying asset</li>
</ul>
<p>Adding Opium’s TURBO options to the aggregation UI will require coordination with the Opium community to ensure a smooth integration.</p>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>The architecture of the aggregation protocol has not yet been defined.</p>
<p>Opium’s TURBO product was chosen as the first derivative supported because the Opium community was offering to help with this integration via documentation and SDKs.</p>
<h2>Considerations</h2>
<p>The specifics of launching an aggregation protocol will not be defined until the 1inch Foundation supports the proposal. Like all new modules they have launched, a complete security review and audit should be performed before this change is implemented on mainnet.</p>
<p>Since all work described in this proposal will be organized by the 1inch Foundation, this will not cost any treasury funds.</p>
