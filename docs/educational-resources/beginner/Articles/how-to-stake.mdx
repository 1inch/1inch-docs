Staking is the process of locking up tokens to participate in a network's DAO governance and consensus mechanism in order to earn rewards. When you stake your tokens on the 1inch Protocols, which operate on a list of supported chains, you gain the opportunity to engage in the 1inch Network's DAO governance and earn rewards.

This guide will provide you with essential information on effectively staking your tokens on the 1inch Protocol, including details about the penalty for unstaking. It's important to note that this guide assumes you already possess a basic understanding of blockchain technology, you are familiar with cryptocurrency wallets, and you possess a knowledge of blockchain transactions. 

To demonstrate the staking process, we will first discuss the unstaking penalties and use a compatible wallet with sufficient funds. For security reasons, you should store your tokens in cold storage wallets and reserve hot storage wallets exclusively for staking purposes.

## Unstaking Penalties
When staking, you have the option to select a custom or preset lock period. It's crucial to understand that your staked 1INCH tokens cannot be withdrawn without a penalty until the designated lock period ends.

The penalty amount is calculated as the balance minus the withdrawal amount. The withdrawal amount is determined by subtracting the voting power from the balance and dividing the result by 0.9. The maximum potential loss for an early withdrawal is 90%, based on a minimum lock period of 1 month.

As time progresses, the penalty for unstaking 1INCH tokens gradually decreases. Additionally, opting for a longer lock period results in receiving a higher amount of UP (Unicorn Power). It's worth noting that the quantity of held Unicorn Power also diminishes over time, similar to the withdrawal penalty.
